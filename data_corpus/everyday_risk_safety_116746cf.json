  "text_en": "hyperactivity disorder Neurodevelopmental disorders 143 Inattention Several symptoms of inattention that are persistent and sufficiently severe that they have a direct negative impact on academic, occupational or social functioning are among the essential components. Symptoms are typically from the following clusters: • having difficulty sustaining attention on tasks that do not provide a high level of stimulation or reward or require sustained mental effort; lacking attention to detail; making careless mistakes in school or work assignments; not completing tasks; • being easily distracted by extraneous stimuli or thoughts not related to the task at hand; often seeming not to listen when spoken to directly; frequently appearing to be daydreaming or to have their mind elsewhere; • losing things; being forgetful in daily activities; having difficulty remembering to complete upcoming daily tasks or activities; having difficulty planning, managing and organizing schoolwork, tasks and other activities. Note: inattention may not be evident when the individual is engaged in activities that provide intense stimulation and frequent rewards. Hyperactivity-impulsivity Several symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity that are persistent and sufficiently severe that they have a direct negative impact on academic, occupational or social functioning are among the essential components. These tend to be most evident in structured situations that require behavioural self-control. Symptoms are typically from the following clusters: • showing excessive motor activity; leaving their seat when expected to sit still; often running about; having difficulty sitting still without fidgeting (younger children); displaying feelings of physical restlessness and a sense of discomfort with being quiet or sitting still (adolescents and adults); • having difficulty engaging in activities quietly; talking too much; • blurting out answers in school or comments at work; having difficulty waiting their turn in conversation, games or activities; interrupting or intruding on others’ conversations or games; • having a tendency to act in response to immediate stimuli without deliberation or consideration of risks and consequences (e.g. engaging in behaviours with potential for physical injury; impulsive decisions; reckless driving). • Evidence of significant inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms prior to age 12, though some individuals may first come to clinical attention later in adolescence or as adults, often when demands exceed the individual’s capacity to compensate for limitations. • Manifestations of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity must be evident across multiple situations or settings (e.g. home, school, work, with friends or relatives), but are likely to vary according to the structure and demands of the setting. • Symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. an anxiety or fear-related disorder, a neurocognitive disorder such as delirium). • Symptoms are not due to the effects of a substance (e.g. cocaine) or medication (e.g. bronchodilators, thyroid replacement medication) on the central nervous system, including and withdrawal effects, and are not due to a disease of the nervous system.
