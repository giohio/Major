Additional clinical features • Voyeuristic disorder should not be diagnosed among children, and is not typically diagnosed among adolescents. Sexual curiosity is typical during adolescence, and observation of others may occur impulsively or opportunistically rather than representing a recurrent pattern of sexual arousal. • The act of observing in voyeuristic disorder is for the purpose of achieving sexual excitement, and does not necessarily involve an attempt to initiate sexual activity with the person being observed. Orgasm by masturbation may occur during the voyeuristic activity or later in response to memories of what the individual has seen. More recently, so-called “video voyeurs” have been described who use video equipment to record individuals in public or private places where there is an expectation of privacy. • The diagnosis of voyeuristic disorder is generally not adequately supported when the evidence indicating a sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal consists solely of a single or very limited number of instances of voyeuristic behaviour, as there may be other explanations for specific occurrences (e.g. intoxication, opportunity). In the absence of a report of the individual’s sexual thoughts, fantasies or urges, examples of other forms of evidence supporting the presence of a voyeuristic arousal pattern include a preference for specific types of pornography; preference over other forms of sexual behaviour; or planning and repeatedly seeking out opportunities to engage in voyeuristic behaviour.
