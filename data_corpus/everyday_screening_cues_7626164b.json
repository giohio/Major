The cultural appropriateness of tests and norms used to assess intellectual, motor, language or social abilities should be considered for each individual. Test performance may be affected by cultural biases (e.g. reference in test items to terminology or objects not common to a culture) and limitations of translation.

There is often substantial variability in the extent to which any of these domains are affected in an individual.
