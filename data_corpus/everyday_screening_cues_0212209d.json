For example, an individual with autism spectrum disorder may be experiencing significant anxiety related to a transition to an unfamiliar environment that does not by itself meet the diagnostic requirements for any anxiety or fear- related disorder. In this case, the symptom category MB24.3 Anxiety could be assigned together with the diagnosis 6A02 Autism spectrum disorder. (The resulting diagnostic code would be 6A02/MB24.3.) Thus, additional symptom codes may be used together with the underlying diagnosis if they convey clinically important additional information. Symptom categories should not be applied in circumstances where they do not convey any additional meaningful information. For example, applying the symptom code MB24.3 Anxiety together with a diagnosis of 6B00 Generalized anxiety disorder would be redundant because anxiety is an essential feature of the disorder itself.
