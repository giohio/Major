  "text_en": "356 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders • Children with reactive attachment disorder related to repetitive maltreatment (e.g. chronic physical or sexual abuse) are at risk of developing co-occurring post-traumatic stress disorder or complex post-traumatic stress disorder. • Children with reactive attachment disorder often exhibit more generalized persistent social and emotional disturbances, including a relative lack of social and emotional responsiveness to others and limited positive affect. There may be episodes of unexplained irritability, sadness or fearfulness that are evident during non-threatening interactions with adult caregivers. • Children with a history of grossly insufficient care but who have nonetheless formed selective attachments do not appear to develop reactive attachment disorder, but they may still be at risk of developing disinhibited social engagement disorder. Boundary with normality (threshold) • Many children without a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder show transient reductions of attachment behaviours towards a parent or caregiver as a normal part of development. In contrast, children with reactive attachment disorder exhibit markedly atypical social responses towards caregivers that persist over time, extend across all social situations, and are not confined to a dyadic relationship with a particular caregiver. Course features • With the provision of adequate care, children with reactive attachment disorder often experience a near or complete remission of symptoms. If appropriate caregiving is not provided, the disorder can persist for several years. • Children with reactive attachment disorder are at higher risk of developing depressive disorders and other internalizing disorders during adolescence and adulthood. They may also experience problems in developing and maintaining healthy interpersonal relationships. • Information about the course features of reactive attachment disorder beyond the childhood years is limited. • Some adults with a history of reactive attachment disorder may experience difficulty in developing interpersonal relationships. Developmental presentations • Caregiver neglect during the first 9 months of life is often an associated precursor to the onset of the disorder. • The features of this disorder become noticeable in a similar fashion up to 5 years of age.
