The level of intoxication is usually related to the dose, route of administration, half-life and duration of action of the substance. Severity of intoxication is also affected by individual variability (e.g. differences in body weight, substance metabolism, tolerance). Susceptibility to substance intoxication may also be greater in individuals with comorbid medical conditions affecting drug pharmacokinetics (e.g. renal or hepatic insufficiency). For some substances, there are specific tests for detecting and determining the concentration of substances in bodily fluids (e.g. blood, urine), which can be important tools for clinical management. However, severity of intoxication should be determined on the basis of clinical assessment, as specified below, and not solely based on the presence and level of the substance in bodily fluids. The level of medical attention that may be required in response to substance intoxication varies according to the severity of intoxication and the substance involved, and varies from precautionary observation to urgent intervention to prevent death or permanent harm (e.g. administration of antagonist treatment, intubation). Severity of intoxication can be rated as mild (XS5W), moderate (XS0T) or severe (XS25), using extension codes, in addition to the appropriate substance intoxication category. To indicate severity, the code for the appropriate severity level is appended to the substance intoxication diagnostic code using an ampersand (&).
