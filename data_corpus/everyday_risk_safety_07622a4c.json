Disorders due to addictive behaviours | Gaming disorder Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours 513 Boundary with normality (threshold) • Gaming disorder should not be diagnosed merely on the basis of repeated or persistent gaming (online or offline) in the absence of the other characteristic features of the disorder. • Daily gaming behaviour as a part of a routine or the use of gaming for purposes such as developing skills and proficiency in gaming, changing mood, alleviating boredom or facilitating social interaction in the absence of the other required features is not a sufficient basis for assigning a diagnosis of gaming disorder. • High rates and long durations of gaming behaviour (online or offline) that occur more commonly among specific age and social groups (e.g. adolescent males), and in particular contexts such as during the holidays or as part of organized gaming activities for entertainment in the absence of the other required features, are also not indicative of a disorder. Cultural, subcultural and peer-group norms should be considered when making a diagnosis. Course features • The course of gaming disorder is typically progressive, as the individual increasingly prioritizes gaming at the expense of other activities. • Individuals with both autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity exhibit elevated rates of problematic gaming and gaming disorder. This appears to be related to preferences for particular types of stimuli, and possibly also to the use of gaming to regulate attention. Developmental presentations • Gaming disorder appears to be most prevalent among adolescent and young adult males aged 12–20 years. Available data suggest that adults have lower prevalence rates. • Among adolescents, gaming disorder has been associated with elevated levels of externalizing (e.g. antisocial behaviour, anger control) and internalizing (e.g. emotional distress, lower self-esteem) problems. Among adults, gaming disorder has been associated with greater levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms. • Adolescents with gaming disorder may be at increased risk of academic underachievement, school failure/dropout, and psychosocial and sleep problems.
