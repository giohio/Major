Neurodevelopmental disorders | Secondary-parented categories in neurodevelopmental disorders Neurodevelopmental disorders 157 Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorder Repetitive, recurrent movements or vocalizations can also be symptomatic of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Tics can be differentiated from obsessive-compulsive disorder because they appear unintentional in nature and clearly utilize a discrete muscle group. However, it can be difficult to distinguish between complex tics and compulsions associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Although tics (both complex and simple) are preceded by premonitory sensory urges, which may diminish over time, tics are not aimed at neutralizing antecedent cognitions (e.g. obsessions) or reducing physiological arousal (e.g. anxiety). Many individuals exhibit symptoms of both obsessive- compulsive disorder and Tourette syndrome, and both diagnoses may be assigned if the diagnostic requirements for each are met. Boundary with self-injurious and self-mutilating behaviours With enough force and repetition, motor tics may lead to self-injury. However, unlike self-injurious and self-mutilating behaviour, Tourette syndrome is not associated with an intention to cause self-injury. 8A05.01 Chronic motor tic disorder Essential (required) features • The persistent presence of motor tics is required for diagnosis. • Motor tics are defined as sudden, rapid, non-rhythmic and recurrent movements. • Motor tics have been present for at least 1 year, with onset during the developmental period. Note: other CDDR elements for chronic motor tic disorder are provided below, following the essential features for chronic phonic tic disorder. 8A05.02 Chronic phonic tic disorder Essential (required) features • The persistent presence of phonic tics is required for diagnosis. • Phonic tics are defined as sudden, rapid, non-rhythmic and recurrent vocalizations. • Phonic tics have been present for at least 1 year, with onset during the developmental period.
