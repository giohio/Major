Sexual acts may occur impulsively or opportunistically during adolescence rather than representing a recurrent pattern of sexual arousal. • The diagnosis of coercive sexual sadism disorder is generally not adequately supported when the evidence indicating a sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal consists solely of a single or very limited number of instances of coercive sadistic sexual behaviour, as there may be other explanations for specific occurrences (e.g. intoxication, opportunity). In the absence of a report of the individual’s sexual thoughts, fantasies or urges, examples of other forms of evidence supporting the presence of a coercive sadistic arousal pattern include a preference for specific types of pornography; preference over other forms of sexual behaviour; planning and repeatedly seeking out opportunities to engage in coercive sadistic sexual behaviour; or laboratory measures of relative viewing time (based on the finding that preferred sexual stimuli are gazed at longer than non- preferred sexual stimuli) and/or penile plethysmography.
