Boundary with other mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders, including mood disorders that are exacerbated premenstrually Mood symptoms characteristic of premenstrual dysphoric disorder – including depressed mood, irritability and anxiety – can be present in other mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, generalized anxiety disorder).

Boundary with dysmenorrhoea Dysmenorrhoea is characterized by cyclic pelvic pain or lower, umbilical or suprapubic abdominal pain preceding or accompanying menstruation that interferes with daily activities. Unlike premenstrual dysphoric disorder, the onset of dysmenorrhoea is coincident with the start of rather than prior to menses.
