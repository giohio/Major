The other types of mood episodes may not follow this pattern. • A substantial majority of the relevant mood episodes should correspond with the seasonal pattern. • A seasonal pattern should be differentiated from an episode that is coincidental with a particular season but predominantly related to a psychological stressor that regularly occurs at that time of the year (e.g. seasonal unemployment). 6A80.5 with rapid cycling • This specifier can be applied if the bipolar type I or bipolar type II disorder is characterized by a high frequency of mood episodes (at least four) over the past 12 months. There may be a switch from one polarity of mood to the other, or the mood episodes may be demarcated by a period of remission. • In individuals with a high frequency of mood episodes, some may have a shorter duration than those usually observed in bipolar type I or bipolar type II disorder. In particular, depressive periods may only last several days. However, if depressive and manic symptoms alternate very rapidly (i.e. from day to day or within the same day), a mixed episode should be diagnosed rather than rapid cycling.
