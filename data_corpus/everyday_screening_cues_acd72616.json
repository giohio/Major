This judgement depends on establishing the following. • The medical condition is known to be capable of producing the symptoms. • The course of the symptoms (e.g. onset, remission, response to treatment of the etiological medical condition) is consistent with causation by the medical condition. • The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. an obsessive- compulsive or related disorder) or the effects of a medication or substance, including withdrawal effects. • The symptoms do not meet the diagnostic requirements for secondary tics, classified in the grouping of movement disorders in Chapter 8 on diseases of the nervous system. • The symptoms are sufficiently severe to be a specific focus of clinical attention.
