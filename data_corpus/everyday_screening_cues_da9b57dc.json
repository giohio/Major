  "text_en": "Neurocognitive disorders 605 Boundary with transient global amnesia Unlike delirium, transient global amnesia is characterized by the presence of isolated memory impairment alongside intact functioning in other cognitive areas (e.g. naming skills, self- identification). Although both disorders may present with memory impairment, delirium is frequently characterized by additional symptoms, including significant confusion, global neurocognitive impairment, and behavioural and emotional disturbance (e.g. hallucinations, agitation). Boundary with factitious disorder and malingering In factitious disorder and malingering, the neurocognitive symptoms characteristic of delirium are consciously feigned. Feigned or induced symptoms may be – although they are not necessarily – atypical in pattern, magnitude or course, or may be medically implausible. Individuals with factitious disorder feign neurocognitive symptoms in order to seek attention, especially from health-care providers, and to assume the sick role. Malingering is characterized by intentional feigning of neurocognitive impairment for obvious external incentives (e.g. disability payments). Boundary with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorder Delirium accompanied by hallucinations and/or delusions is differentiated from schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders by the absence of other characteristics of these disorders, and by symptoms that are transient and fluctuate depending on the underlying causal condition or etiology. Boundary with dissociative amnesia Selective memory deficits are present in dissociative amnesia, and may be accompanied by confusion about identity if dissociative fugue is present. Dissociative amnesia is not characterized by disturbances in attention or awareness, general confusion or global neurocognitive impairment, which are features of delirium. 6D70.0 Delirium due to disease classified elsewhere Essential (required) features • All diagnostic requirements for delirium are met. • There is evidence from the history, physical examination or laboratory findings that the neurocognitive disturbance is caused by the direct physiological consequences of a medical condition.
