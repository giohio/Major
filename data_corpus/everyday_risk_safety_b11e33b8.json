When present, these problems often persist into adulthood. These disorders are characterized by behaviours that range from those described as disruptive – that is, markedly and persistently defiant, disobedient, provocative or spiteful – to behaviours that are considered dissocial because they persistently violate the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms, rules or laws. A majority of individuals commit isolated acts of aggression or rule violation at some point in their lives, and this does not warrant the diagnosis of a disruptive behaviour or dissocial disorder. In all cases, the behaviours characteristic of the disorders in this grouping must clearly depart from the normal range for the individual’s age and gender, given their sociocultural context. Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders may co-occur with other mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, a separate diagnosis of a disruptive behaviour or dissocial disorder is not warranted if the disruptive behaviour is limited to symptomatic episodes of another mental disorder (e.g. defiant and noncompliant behaviour during a depressive episode), or if the behaviour is due to the effects of a substance or to another medical condition. Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders are frequently associated with psychosocial environments that include family dysfunction; problems with peers, co-workers and romantic partners; and failure at school or work. Other psychosocial risk factors are common, such as peer rejection, deviant peer-group influences and parental mental disorder. Behaviours that are adaptive given the individual’s environmental circumstances (e.g. running away from an abusive home; stealing in order to survive) should not be used as the sole basis for these diagnoses. Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders include the following: 6C90 Oppositional defiant disorder 6C90.0 Oppositional defiant disorder, with chronic irritability-anger",
