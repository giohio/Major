Given that individuals experiencing a hypomanic episode often have a subjective experience of improved functioning (e.g. greater productivity and creativity at work), they rarely seek clinical care during such episodes. Thus, hypomanic episodes usually must be assessed retrospectively in individuals presenting with depressive symptoms. • Individuals initially diagnosed with bipolar type II disorder are at high risk of experiencing a manic or mixed episode during their lifetime. If this occurs, the diagnosis should be changed to bipolar type I disorder. • Patients diagnosed with bipolar type I and bipolar type II disorders are at elevated risk of developing a variety of medical conditions affecting the cardiovascular system (e.g. hypertension) and metabolism (e.g. hyperglycaemia), some of which may be due to the effects of the chronic use of medications used to treat bipolar disorders. • Individuals with bipolar type I or bipolar type II disorder exhibit high rates of co-occurring mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders, most commonly anxiety and fear- related disorders and disorders due to substance use. Boundary with normality (threshold) for bipolar type I and bipolar type II disorders • The presence or history of hypomanic episodes in the absence of a history of at least one depressive episode is not a sufficient basis for a presumptive diagnosis of bipolar type II disorder. Culture-related features for bipolar type I and bipolar type II disorders • Studies indicate that the prevalence of bipolar and related disorders varies across cultural, ethnic and migrant groups, partly as a function of social stress. Symptom expression may also vary and be shaped by common cultural idioms, cultural histories or personal histories that are prominent in identity formation and expressed as grandiose ideas or beliefs. For example, grandiosity may be expressed in culturally specific ways such that a Muslim individual experiencing a manic episode may believe they are Muhammad, whereas a Christian individual may believe they are Jesus. Individuals from the person’s cultural group may be helpful in distinguishing normative expressions of belief or ritual from manic or psychotic experiences and behaviours. • In some cultural contexts, mood changes are more readily expressed in the form of bodily symptoms (e.g. pain, fatigue, weakness) rather than directly reported as psychological symptoms. • The perceived abnormality or acceptability of depressive symptoms may vary across cultures, affecting symptom detection and treatment acceptability. For example, some social groups or age cohorts may consider depressive symptoms to be normal reactions to adversity, depending on their tolerance of negative emotions or social withdrawal.
