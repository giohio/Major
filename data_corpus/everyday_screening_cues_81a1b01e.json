Social anxiety disorder should only be considered in cases in which the individual reports social fear, anxiety, and avoidance that are clearly in excess of what is normative for the specific cultural context and result in significant distress or impairment.

A poorer long-term prognosis has been associated with greater symptom severity and co-occurring disorders due to use of alcohol, personality disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder and agoraphobia. • Remission rates for social anxiety disorder vary widely, with some individuals experiencing spontaneous remission of symptoms. Developmental presentations • Social anxiety disorder is less prevalent among young children under the age of 10 years, with occurrence of the disorder increasing significantly during adolescence. • In children, the diagnosis of social anxiety disorder should not be used to describe developmentally normative stranger anxiety or shyness. • Social anxiety disorder is associated with the temperamental trait of behavioural inhibition – that is, the tendency for some individuals to experience novel situations as distressing and to withdraw from or avoid unfamiliar contexts or people.
