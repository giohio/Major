  "text_en": "Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis) Boundary with other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders Repetitive behaviours observed in trichotillomania occur in other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, but these are typically related to specific foci of apprehension, and are associated with distinct intent for each diagnostic entity. Individuals diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder may engage in hair-pulling behaviour (e.g. as a symmetry ritual meant to “balance” their hair). Furthermore, individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder often exhibit other symmetry rituals alongside identifiable obsessions and compulsions unrelated to hair pulling. Nonetheless, co-occurrence with obsessive-compulsive disorder is common, and if both disorders are present, both may be diagnosed. Body dysmorphic disorder may be associated with removal of body hair that the individual perceives as ugly or as appearing abnormal. Boundary with stereotyped movement disorder Stereotyped movement disorder is characterized by the persistent (e.g. lasting for several months) presence of voluntary, repetitive, stereotyped, apparently purposeless and often rhythmic movements (e.g. body rocking, hand flapping, head banging, eye poking and hand biting). These behaviours rarely include hair-pulling behaviour, but if they do, the behaviour tends to be composed of coordinated movements that are patterned and predictable. Furthermore, stereotyped movements are more likely to present very early in life (i.e. before 2 years of age), whereas trichotillomania typically has an onset in early adolescence. Boundary with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders Individuals with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders may remove hair in response to a delusion or hallucination. An additional diagnosis of trichotillomania should not be assigned in such cases. Boundary with medical conditions classified elsewhere and disorders due to substance use The symptoms of trichotillomania are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. inflammation of the hair follicles). Skin biopsy or dermoscopy are able to differentiate individuals with trichotillomania from those with dermatological disorders. Although hair-pulling behaviour may be exacerbated by certain substances (e.g. amfetamine), there is no evidence that substances can be the primary cause of recurrent hair pulling. 6B25.1 Excoriation (skin-picking) disorder Essential (required) features • The presentation is characterized by: • recurrent picking of the individual’s skin; • unsuccessful attempts to stop or decrease skin picking; • significant skin lesions resulting from picking behaviour.
