Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Social anxiety disorder Anxiety and fear-related disorders 287 Sex- and/or gender-related features • Whereas prevalence rates for social anxiety disorder are higher for women in community samples, gender differences are not observed in clinical samples. The disparity in prevalence across settings has been attributed to gender role expectations, such that men experiencing greater severity of symptoms are more willing to seek professional services. • Women report greater symptom severity and a greater variety of social fears, whereas men are more likely to experience anxiety related to dating and urinating in public. • Co-occurring depressive, bipolar and anxiety and fear-related disorders are more common among women, whereas men are more likely to experience co-occurring oppositional defiant disorder, conduct-dissocial disorder and disorders due to substance use. • The use of alcohol and illicit drugs to relieve symptoms of social anxiety disorder is more common among men. Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis) Boundary with generalized anxiety disorder Generalized anxiety disorder can be differentiated from social anxiety disorder because the main focus of worry is negative consequences that can occur in multiple everyday situations (e.g. work, relationships, finances) rather than being restricted to concerns about one’s behaviour or appearance being negatively evaluated in social situations. Boundary with panic disorder If an individual with social anxiety disorder experiences panic attacks exclusively in the context of actual or anticipated social or performance situations, an additional diagnosis of panic disorder is not warranted, and the presence of panic attacks may be indicated using the with panic attacks specifier. However, if unexpected panic attacks also occur, an additional diagnosis of panic disorder may be assigned. Boundary with agoraphobia Fear or anxiety in agoraphobia centres on imminent perceived dangerous outcomes (e.g. panic attacks, symptoms of panic, incapacitation or embarrassing physical symptoms) that are anticipated to occur in multiple situations where obtaining help or escaping might be difficult rather than on concerns about being negatively evaluated by others. Unlike social anxiety disorder, embarrassment in agoraphobia is secondary to concerns that escape or obtaining assistance may not be possible should symptoms (e.g. diarrhoea in a public place) occur. Boundary with specific phobia Specific phobia can be differentiated from social anxiety disorder because, in general, fears are of specific situations or stimuli (e.g. heights, animals, blood-injury) and not of social situations.
