Note: a diagnosis of 8A01.10 Huntington disease in Chapter 8 on diseases of the nervous system should also be assigned. 6D85.2 Dementia due to exposure to heavy metals and other toxins Essential (required) features • All diagnostic requirements for dementia are met. • Dementia is presumed to be attributable to toxic exposure to specific heavy metals, such as aluminium from dialysis water, lead, mercury or manganese, as demonstrated by neuropsychological test data, neuroimaging data, medical tests and/or clinical history. Additional clinical features • The characteristic neurocognitive impairments in dementia due to exposure to heavy metals and other toxins depend on the specific heavy metal or toxin that the individual has been exposed to, but can affect any cognitive domain. • Onset of symptoms is related to exposure, and progression can be rapid especially with acute exposure. • In some cases, symptoms are reversible when exposure is identified and ceases. Note: an appropriate diagnosis from the NE61 Harmful effects of or exposure to noxious substances, chiefly nonmedicinal as to source, not elsewhere classified, grouping in Chapter 22 on injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes should also be assigned. 6D85.3 Dementia due to HIV Essential (required) features • All diagnostic requirements for dementia are met. • Dementia is presumed to be attributable to underlying HIV disease, as demonstrated by neuropsychological test data, neuroimaging data, medical tests and/or clinical history.
