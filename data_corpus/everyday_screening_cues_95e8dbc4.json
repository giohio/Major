Symptomatic and course presentation specifiers for mood episodes in bipolar type I and bipolar type II disorders Additional specifiers may be applied to describe a current mood episode in the context of bipolar type I disorder (depressive, manic, mixed or hypomanic episodes) and bipolar type II disorder (depressive or hypomanic episodes). These specifiers indicate other important features of the clinical presentation or of the course, onset and pattern of mood episodes. These specifiers are not mutually exclusive, and as many may be added as apply. (Note that these same specifiers may also be applied to current depressive episodes in the context of depressive disorders, with the exception of rapid cycling, which is specific to bipolar type I and bipolar type II disorders.) Available specifiers are as follows: 6A80.0 with prominent anxiety symptoms • This specifier can be applied if, in the context of a current depressive, manic, mixed or hypomanic episode, prominent and clinically significant anxiety symptoms (e.g. feeling nervous, anxious or on edge, not being able to control worrying thoughts, fear that something awful will happen, having trouble relaxing, muscle tension, autonomic symptoms) have been present for most of the time during the episode. If there have been panic attacks during the current depressive or mixed episode, these should be recorded separately (see the with panic attacks specifier). When the diagnostic requirements for both a mood episode and an anxiety or fear-related disorder are met, the anxiety or fear- related disorder should also be diagnosed. 6A80.1 with panic attacks • This specifier can be applied if, in the context of a current episode, there have been panic attacks during the past month that occur specifically in response to depressive ruminations or other anxiety-provoking cognitions. If panic attacks occur exclusively in response to such thoughts, the with panic attacks specifier should be applied rather than an additional co-occurring diagnosis of panic disorder. If some panic attacks over the course of the depressive or mixed episode have been unexpected and not exclusively in response to depressive or anxiety-provoking thoughts, and the full diagnostic requirements for panic disorder are met, a separate diagnosis of panic disorder should be assigned.
