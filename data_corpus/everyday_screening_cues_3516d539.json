  "text_en": "social contexts. Boundary with autism spectrum disorder Individuals with autism spectrum disorder and social anxiety disorder may both appear to be socially withdrawn. However, those with autism spectrum disorder can be differentiated because of the presence of social communication deficits and, typically, a lack of interest in social interactions. Boundary with depressive disorders Beliefs of social inadequacy, rejection and failure are common in depressive disorders, and may be associated with avoidance of social situations. However, unlike in social anxiety disorder, these symptoms occur almost exclusively during a depressive episode. Boundary with body dysmorphic disorder In body dysmorphic disorder, individuals worry about a perceived physical defect that is often undetectable or very minor from the point of view of others. These individuals may be concerned about others’ negative judgement of the perceived defect. However, unlike in social anxiety disorder, their concerns are restricted to how others will evaluate the perceived defect rather than other aspects of their behaviour or appearance across social contexts. Boundary with olfactory reference disorder In social anxiety disorder, social situations are avoided because the individual is concerned that they will act in a way, or show anxiety symptoms, that will be negatively evaluated by others (i.e. be humiliating, be embarrassing, lead to rejection or be offensive). In contrast, individuals with olfactory reference disorder may avoid social situations specifically because they believe they are emitting a foul odour. Boundary with oppositional defiant disorder Irritability, anger and noncompliance are sometimes associated with anxiety in children and adolescents. For example, children may exhibit angry outbursts when asked to enter situations that make them feel anxious (e.g. being asked to attend a social gathering). If the defiant behaviours only occur when triggered by a situation or stimulus that elicits anxiety, fear or panic, a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder is generally not appropriate. Boundary with other mental and behavioural syndromes due to another medical condition Individuals with certain medical conditions (e.g. Parkinson disease) and those with other mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. schizophrenia) may demonstrate avoidance of social situations because of concerns that others will negatively evaluate their symptoms (e.g. tremor, unusual behaviours). An additional diagnosis of social anxiety disorder should only be assigned if all diagnostic requirements are met, taking into consideration that it is normal for individuals with visible symptoms of a medical condition to experience some concerns about how others perceive their symptoms. Typically, individuals with medical conditions adapt to concerns related to their manifest symptoms and do not display persistent excessive fear or anxiety in social situations.
