Sudden or late onset, in particular, should prompt additional assessment to differentiate obsessive-compulsive disorder from other medical conditions (e.g. basal ganglia ischaemic stroke) that may better explain the symptoms. • Many adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder (30–50%) report a childhood onset of symptoms. For those with onset during childhood or adolescence, 40% may experience remission of symptoms by early adulthood. • Obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults is generally considered a chronic condition, with waxing and waning of symptoms. Some experience an episodic course and a minority experience a worsening course. Developmental presentations • Onset before the age of 10 years is more common among males (approximately 25%), whereas adolescent onset is more likely among females. Younger age of onset is associated with greater genetic loading and poorer outcomes due to interference of symptoms with achieving developmental milestones (e.g. forming peer relationships, acquiring academic skills). Although childhood-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder typically follows a chronic course, particularly if left untreated, symptoms tend to wax and wane and many (approximately 40%) experience full remission by early adulthood. Among older adults, the prevalence of obsessive-compulsive disorder is slightly higher among men than women. • Although precipitous onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms in children and adolescents has been reported, often attributed to paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS), development of symptoms is typically gradual. • The content and type of obsessions and compulsions varies across the lifespan. Children and adolescents are more likely to report obsessions centred upon bad things happening to their loved ones (e.g. parents), whereas adolescents and adults are more likely to report religious or sexual obsessions. Among children and adolescents, females are more likely to report symptoms centred upon contamination or cleaning, whereas males are more likely to report symptoms of a sexual, religious or aggressive nature. It may be easier to assess for the presence of compulsions in children because their level of cognitive development may preclude verbalizing content of obsessions. • Among children and adolescents, the course of obsessive-compulsive disorder is frequently complicated by the co-occurrence of other mental disorders, the presence of which may affect identification of obsessive-compulsive disorder among young people. Up to 30% of all individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder will also experience Tourette syndrome or another primary tic disorder during their lifetime. Co-occurring tics are more common among males with childhood-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder. Children and adolescents are also more likely than adults to present with a combination of obsessive- compulsive disorder, a primary tic disorder and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Body dysmorphic disorder or hoarding disorder often co-occur among adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Approximately half of elderly patients with obsessive- compulsive disorder exhibit ordering, hoarding and checking behaviours, which may also reflect symptoms of personality disorder with anankastic traits.
