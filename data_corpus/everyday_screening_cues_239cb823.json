Panic attacks that occur entirely in these contexts do not warrant an additional, separate diagnosis of panic disorder. Instead, the with panic attacks specifier (MB23.H) may be applied together with the post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis. However, if unexpected panic attacks (i.e. those that come on “out of the blue”) are also present and the other diagnostic requirements are met, an additional diagnosis of panic disorder is appropriate. Boundary with specific phobia In some cases, a situational or conditioned specific phobia can arise after exposure to a traumatic event (e.g. being attacked by a dog). Specific phobia can generally be differentiated from post- traumatic stress disorder by the absence of re-experiencing of the event in the present. Although phobic responses may include powerful memories of the event, in response to which the individual experiences anxiety, the memories are experienced as belonging to the past. Boundary with dissociative disorders Following an experience of a traumatic event, a variety of dissociative symptoms can occur, including somatic symptoms, memory disturbances, flashbacks or other trance-like states, alterations in identity and sense of agency, and experiences of depersonalization, especially during the episodes of re-experiencing. If the dissociative symptoms are confined to episodes of re-experiencing in an individual with post-traumatic stress disorder or complex post-traumatic stress disorder, an additional diagnosis of a dissociative disorder should not be assigned. If significant dissociative symptoms are present outside episodes of re-experiencing, and the full diagnostic requirements are met, an additional dissociative disorder diagnosis may be assigned. Boundary with other mental disorders It is common for mental disorders other than or in addition to post-traumatic stress disorder to develop in the aftermath of an event or situation (either short- or long-lasting) of an extremely threatening or horrific nature. Thus, a history of exposure to a potentially traumatic event does not in itself indicate the presence of post-traumatic stress disorder. Depressive disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders, disorders due to substance use, and dissociative disorders can all occur in the aftermath of potentially traumatic experiences, often in the absence of post-traumatic stress disorder. 6B41 Complex post-traumatic stress disorder Essential (required) features • Exposure to an event or series of events of an extremely threatening or horrific nature – most commonly prolonged or repetitive events from which escape is difficult or impossible – is required for diagnosis. Such events include, but are not limited to, torture, concentration camps, slavery, genocide campaigns and other forms of organized violence, prolonged domestic violence, and repeated childhood sexual or physical abuse.
