Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis) Boundary with other dissociative disorders Experiences of depersonalization and derealization are common in other dissociative disorders – particularly dissociative identity disorder, partial dissociative identity disorder, trance disorder and possession trance disorder. If the diagnostic requirements for another dissociative disorder are met, an additional diagnosis of depersonalization-derealization disorder should not be assigned. Boundary with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders In schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, non-transient experiences of depersonalization or derealization are common during psychotic episodes, and may be accompanied by delusional interpretations of this experience. If depersonalization and/or derealization are limited to periods of psychotic symptoms in an individual with schizophrenia or another primary psychotic disorder, an additional diagnosis of depersonalization-derealization disorder should not be assigned. Boundary with depressive disorders Depersonalization and derealization are common during depressive episodes, and may be persistent. An additional diagnosis of depersonalization-derealization disorder should not be assigned if the symptoms occur only during depressive episodes, or are otherwise better accounted for by a depressive disorder. Boundary with panic attacks Panic attacks in the context of panic disorder or other mental disorders may be associated with marked experiences of depersonalization-derealization, which may persist for a time after the panic episode subsides. If depersonalization-derealization symptoms occur exclusively during panic attacks or continue only for a brief period afterwards, a separate diagnosis of depersonalization- derealization disorder is not warranted. Boundary with other anxiety and fear-related disorders Transient experiences of depersonalization or derealization are also common in other anxiety and fear-related disorders such as social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. If depersonalization and/or derealization is better accounted for by an anxiety or fear-related disorder (for example, these experiences occur only in the context of confrontation with the corresponding focus of apprehension), an additional diagnosis of depersonalization-derealization disorder should not be assigned.
