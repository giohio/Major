Additional clinical features • A variety of reasons may be given for restriction of food intake, such as lack of interest in eating, avoidance of foods with certain sensory characteristics (e.g. smell, taste, appearance, texture, colour, temperature) or concern about perceived aversive consequences of eating (e.g. choking, vomiting, health problems), which in some cases is related to a history of aversive food-related experience such as choking or vomiting after eating a particular type of food. In many cases, however, there is no identifiable event that preceded the onset of the disorder. • Some individuals with avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder present with a longstanding lack of interest in food or eating, chronically low appetite or poor ability to recognize hunger. In other cases, restriction of food intake may be more variable and significantly affected by emotional or psychological factors. This latter pattern may be associated with high levels of distractibility or with high levels of emotional arousal and extreme resistance in situations in which eating is expected. Individuals with this pattern, especially children, often require significant prompting and encouragement to eat. • Individuals with avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder generally do not experience any difficulties eating foods within their preferred range, and may therefore not be underweight. • Avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder can negatively affect family functioning, such that mealtimes may be associated with increased distress (e.g. infants may be more irritable during feeding, children may try to negotiate what food is present or how much they need to consume at mealtimes). Boundary with normality (threshold) • People with unusual patterns of eating behaviour or who are exceptionally “picky eaters” should not be diagnosed with avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder in the absence of significant weight loss or other health consequences (e.g. clinically significant nutritional deficiencies, increases in blood lipids due to selective eating of fatty foods) or impairment in psychosocial functioning (e.g. limited participation in social activities where preferred foods are not available). Distress on the part of parents or other caregivers related to selective eating in the absence of identifiable health consequences or impairment in the individual’s functioning is not a basis for assigning the diagnosis.
