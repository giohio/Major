The diagnosis can be assigned in either case. • Voiding of urine during sleep may take place during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, leading some individuals to report having dreamt of urinating. • Diurnal enuresis may occur in children who avoid urination due to social anxiety about using a public bathroom or due to refusal to cease an activity that is enjoyable (e.g. playing a game). • Enuresis may lead to the development of psychological problems due to associated distress or stigma. Enuresis may be an aspect of another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder, or both enuresis and another emotional/behavioural disturbance may arise in parallel due to related etiological factors. A diagnosis of enuresis may be assigned together with other mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder diagnoses if the enuresis is a distinct focus of clinical attention.
