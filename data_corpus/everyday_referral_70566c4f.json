  "text_en": "Introduction 1 Introduction The Eleventh Revision of the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) was approved by the Seventy-second World Health Assembly, comprising the health ministers of all World Health Organization (WHO) Member States, on 25 May 2019 (1). ICD-11 represents the first major, comprehensive revision of the ICD in nearly 30 years, and incorporates major advances in scientific evidence, best clinical practices and health information systems (2). The development and maintenance of international classification systems for health and the standardization of diagnostic procedures are core constitutional functions of WHO (3). By international treaty, WHO’s 194 Member States agree to use the ICD as the standard for the reporting of health information to WHO. The ICD is therefore the fundamental global framework for monitoring mortality and morbidity, epidemics and other threats to public health, and disease burden. Reporting of health statistics to WHO based on the new system began on 1 January 2022 (4). Member States also use the ICD for other important purposes related to health services – for example, to facilitate access to appropriate health care, as a basis for developing clinical guidelines and standards of practice, and to facilitate research into more effective prevention and treatment strategies. Moreover, the governments of Member States use the ICD as a part of the framework for defining their obligations to provide free or subsidized health-care services to their populations (5). That is, the diagnosis of a particular health condition typically confers eligibility to receive a specified range of health services. The implementation of the ICD in clinical systems is therefore extremely important because of the way it drives services, costs and outcomes. This volume, Clinical descriptions and diagnostic requirements for ICD-11 mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders (CDDR), is the culmination of over a decade of collaborative work that took place within the context of the overall development of ICD-11 (2). The development of the ICD-11 CDDR was led by the WHO Department of Mental Health and Substance Use, and constitutes the most broadly international, multilingual, multidisciplinary and participative revision process ever implemented for a classification of mental disorders (6). The CDDR were planned, developed and field tested with the intent of providing mental health professionals, other health professionals, trainees and students with a comprehensive clinically useful guide to implementation of the ICD-11 classification of mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders. The CDDR are meant to support the accurate and reliable identification of mental health problems as they present in people seeking care in different settings worldwide, based on the best available evidence. Timely and accurate diagnosis of mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders can reduce the enormous disease burden associated with these conditions (7), thereby advancing WHO’s objective of “the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health” (3, p. 2). The CDDR are an integral part of ICD-11, but they are distinct from the version used by Member States for statistical reporting of health information, which is referred to as the linearization for mortality and morbidity statistics (MMS) (8). The MMS contain brief descriptions (or definitions) that are meant to be used for statistical and health information purposes for most categories in ICD-11, including all categories in the mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders chapter. In contrast, the CDDR, which have been developed specifically for the ICD-11 mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders chapter, provide substantially more detailed information needed by mental health and other health professionals to understand and apply this part of the classification in their work with patients. 2 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders A brief history of the CDDR ICD-6 (9) was the first version of the classification published by WHO, the",
