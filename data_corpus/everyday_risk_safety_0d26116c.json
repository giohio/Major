Course features • Many individuals with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder report a history of sexually acting out during pre-adolescence or adolescence (e.g. risky sexual behaviour, masturbation to modulate negative affect, extensive use of pornography). Developmental presentations • Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder in adulthood has been associated with high rates of childhood traumas, including sexual abuse, with women reporting higher rates and severity of abuse. • Adolescents and adults with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder commonly experience high rates of co-occurring mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders, including disorders due to substance use. • Assessing the presence of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder may be particularly challenging during adolescence due to divergent views regarding the appropriateness of sexual behaviour during this life stage. Increased frequency of sexual behaviour or uncontrolled sexual urges associated with rapidly changing hormonal levels during this developmental stage may be considered to reflect normal adolescent experiences. Conversely, frequent or risky sexual behaviour among adolescents may be considered abnormal due to the potential for the behaviour to interfere with social and emotional development. Culture-related features • Cultural and subcultural variation may exist for compulsive sexual behaviour.
