More severe presentations of the disorder in childhood are more likely to persist into adolescence and adulthood. Developmental presentations • Developmental speech fluency disorder emerges early in the developmental period, typically between 2.5 and 4 years of age. Around 5–8% of preschool-aged children exhibit stuttering; 80–90% of cases develop by age 6, and onset after age 9 is rare. The lifetime incidence of stuttering is estimated at 5%, whereas population prevalence is estimated at approximately 1%. • Dysfluency tends to emerge gradually and may worsen as the individual becomes aware of their fluency difficulty. This may lead to development of mechanisms to avoid dysfluency or the associated emotional discomfort, further impairing speech (e.g. avoiding public speaking or limiting speech to simple and short phrases). Sex- and/or gender-related features • Across the developmental period, boys are more commonly affected. Among preschool- aged children, the ratio of boys to girls with developmental speech fluency disorder is estimated at 1.5:1. However, females are more likely to remit. Throughout school age and into adulthood, affected males are estimated to outnumber affected females by a ratio of 4:1. Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis) Boundary with developmental speech sound disorder and developmental language disorder Like developmental speech fluency disorder, developmental speech sound disorder and developmental language disorder can result in reduced intelligibility that significantly affects communication. Developmental speech sound disorder is characterized by errors of pronunciation that are outside the limits of normal variation for chronological or developmental age. Developmental language disorder is characterized by persistent difficulties in the acquisition, understanding, production or use of language. In contrast, developmental speech fluency disorder is characterized by disruption of the normal rhythmic flow and rate of speech. If the diagnostic requirements for both developmental fluency disorder and another developmental speech and language disorder are met, both diagnoses may be assigned.
