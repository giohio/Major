Depending on the nature of the medical condition (e.g. a life-threatening type of cancer, a potentially fatal infection) or its onset (e.g. a heart attack, a stroke, a severe injury), being diagnosed and/or having to cope with a severe medical condition can be experienced as a traumatic event, which may trigger dissociative symptoms. In the absence of evidence of a physiological link between the medical condition and the dissociative symptoms, a diagnosis of secondary dissociative syndrome is not warranted. Instead, the appropriate mental disorder can be diagnosed (e.g. adjustment disorder, depersonalization-derealization disorder). Potentially explanatory medical conditions (examples) Brain disorders and general medical conditions that have been shown to be capable of producing dissociative syndromes include: • diseases of the nervous system (e.g. encephalitis, migraine, seizures, stroke); • endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases (e.g. hyperglycaemia); • injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes (e.g. intracranial injury); • neoplasms (e.g. neoplasms of brain). 6E66 Secondary impulse control syndrome Essential (required) features • The presence of prominent symptoms that are characteristic of impulse control disorders or disorders due to addictive behaviours (e.g. stealing, fire setting, aggressive outbursts, compulsive sexual behaviour, excessive gambling) is required for diagnosis. • The symptoms are judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of a medical condition, based on evidence from history, physical examination or laboratory findings.
