If fluoxetine or venlafaxine are chosen, they should be co-administered with a mood stabilizer (namely quetiapine, olanzapine, carbamazepine, valproic acid [sodium valproate], lithium). Conditional recommendation. Very low certainty of evidence. PSY10 (update) Treatment based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) should be considered for adults with psychotic disorders (including schizophrenia) in the acute phase of the condition where sufficient specialist support is available. Conditional recommendation. Moderate certainty of evidence. PSY11 (update) Psychosocial interventions – namely family interventions, family psychoeducation, psychoeducation and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) – should be offered to adults with psychosis (including schizophrenia) during the maintenance phase, either alone or in combination. Strong recommendation. Moderate certainty of evidence. PSY12 (update) Individual psychological interventions – namely cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), family psychoeducation, medicine adherence therapy, online psychoeducation or psychoeducation – should be considered as adjunctive to pharmacological interventions in the treatment of adults with bipolar disorder in remission. Conditional recommendation. Low certainty of evidence. Self-harm and suicide (SUI) SUI1 (new) Safety planning type-interventions, i.e. interventions based on principles of safety planning which are multicomponent or supplemented with follow-up or support, can be considered. Conditional recommendation. Very low certainty of evidence. SUI2 The evidence regarding effectiveness of stand-alone media campaigns (to raise awareness and sensitize the general public about suicide and its prevention) in reducing deaths from suicide, suicide attempts and acts of self-harm is insufficient to make a recommendation. SUI3 (new) Stand-alone digital interventions based on evidence-based interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT), problem-solving therapy (PST) and mindfulness should be considered as support for persons with suicidal thoughts.
