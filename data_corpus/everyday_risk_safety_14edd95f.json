This designation should not be used to describe mild and transient depressive symptoms that do not meet the diagnostic requirements for a depressive episode, which may occur soon after delivery (so-called “postpartum blues” or “baby blues”).

Additional clinical features for single episode depressive disorder and recurrent depressive disorder • Suicide risk is significantly higher among individuals diagnosed with single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder than among the general population. • Recurrent panic attacks in single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder may be indicative of greater severity, poorer response to treatment, and greater risk of suicide. • The presence of dementia or a disorder of intellectual development does not rule out the diagnosis of single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder, but communication difficulties may make it necessary to rely more than usual on observations made by clinicians or knowledgeable collateral informants to make the diagnosis. Observable symptoms include psychomotor retardation, loss of appetite and weight, and sleep disturbance. • There is a greater risk of single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder among individuals with a family history of single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder.
