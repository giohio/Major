Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Specific phobia 282 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders • Specific phobias related to tangible objects (e.g. animals) are more common in younger children, whereas those relating to possible harm to oneself or others (e.g. environmental, blood/injection) are more common in adolescents and adults. • As with adults, excessive avoidance is seen in both children and adolescents, and may be driven by either the actual presence of the phobic stimuli or anticipatory anxiety (e.g. refusing to go outside because of the possible presence of bees). Culture-related features • Culture may play a role in shaping the fear response to specific stimuli. A diagnosis of specific phobia should not be assigned if a stimulus is feared by most people in a cultural group, unless the fear exceeds cultural norms. For example, people from some cultural groups may avoid walking at night in certain areas where they fear ghosts or spirits may be present. • The salience of specific feared stimuli may differ by cultural group and environmental context. Common threats in the environment (e.g. poisonous snakes) may account for some of the cultural variation in feared stimuli. Sex- and/or gender-related features • Lifetime prevalence of specific phobia is approximately twice as high among females. • Whereas males and females are equally likely to experience phobias related to blood, injection and injury, situationally specific phobias and those related to animals and natural environments are more common among females. Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis) Boundary with panic disorder If an individual with specific phobia experiences panic attacks exclusively in the context of actual or anticipated encounters with the specific object or situation that represents the focus of apprehension, an additional diagnosis of panic disorder is not warranted, and the presence of panic attacks may be indicated using the with panic attacks specifier. However, if unexpected panic attacks also occur, an additional diagnosis of panic disorder may be assigned. Boundary with agoraphobia Specific phobia is differentiated from agoraphobia because it involves fear of circumscribed situations or stimuli (e.g. heights, animals, blood-injury) rather than because of fear or anxiety of imminent perceived dangerous outcomes (e.g. panic attacks, symptoms of panic, incapacitation Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Specific phobia",
