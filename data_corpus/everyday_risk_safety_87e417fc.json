Dissociative disorders | Dissociative identity disorder Dissociative disorders 387 Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorder Obsessive-compulsive disorder involves repetitive and persistent thoughts (e.g. of contamination), images (e.g. of violent scenes) or impulses/urges (e.g. to stab someone) that are experienced as intrusive and unwanted (obsessions), as well as repetitive behaviours – including repetitive mental acts – that the individual feels driven to perform (compulsions). However, obsessive-compulsive disorder is not characterized by discontinuities in the sense of self and agency, or the presence of two or more distinct personality states. Boundary with personality disorder Personality disorder, particularly with borderline pattern, is characterized by persistent disturbances in sense of identity and self-direction, and often by problems with affect regulation. Personality disorder does not involve the presence of two or more distinct personality states, but some individuals with severe personality disorder exhibit transient dissociative experiences during times of stress or intense emotion. 6B65 Partial dissociative identity disorder Essential (required) features • Disruption of identity characterized by the experience of two or more distinct personality states (dissociative identities), involving discontinuities in the sense of self and agency, is required for diagnosis. Each personality state includes its own pattern of experiencing, perceiving, conceiving and relating to self, the body and the environment. • One personality state is dominant and functions in daily life (e.g. parenting, work), but is intruded upon by one or more non-dominant personality states (dissociative intrusions). These intrusions may be cognitive (intruding thoughts), affective (intruding affects such as fear, anger or shame), perceptual (e.g. intruding voices, fleeting visual perceptions, sensations such as being touched), motor (e.g. involuntary movements of an arm) or behavioural (e.g. an action that lacks a sense of agency or ownership). These experiences are experienced as interfering with the functioning of the dominant personality state and are typically aversive. • The non-dominant personality states do not recurrently take executive control of the individual’s consciousness and functioning to the extent that they perform in specific aspects of daily life (e.g. parenting, work). However, there may be occasional, limited and transient episodes in which a distinct personality state assumes executive control to engage in circumscribed behaviours (e.g. in response to extreme emotional states or during episodes of self-harm or the re-enactment of traumatic memories). • The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. schizophrenia or another primary psychotic disorder). • The symptoms are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system – including withdrawal effects – (e.g. blackouts or chaotic behaviour during substance intoxication), and are not due to a disease of the nervous system (e.g. complex partial seizures) or to a sleep-wake disorder (e.g. symptoms occur during hypnagogic or hypnopompic states). • The symptoms result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort. Dissociative disorders | Partial dissociative identity disorder",
