  "text_en": "640 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders 6E20 Mental and behavioural disorders associated with pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium, without psychotic symptoms Essential (required) features • Onset of a syndrome involving significant mental and behavioural features occurring during pregnancy or the puerperium (i.e. up to about 6 weeks following delivery) is required for diagnosis. • The syndrome does not include delusions, hallucinations or other psychotic symptoms. • The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. a brain tumour), and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (e.g. benzodiazepines), including withdrawal effects (e.g. from stimulants). • The disturbance results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort. Note: if the symptoms meet the diagnostic requirements for a specific mental disorder (e.g. a mood disorder, an anxiety or fear-related disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, adjustment disorder), that diagnosis should also be assigned. If the symptoms do not meet the diagnostic requirements for a specific mental disorder, the presentation can be described using codes from the section on mental or behavioural symptoms, signs or clinical findings (p. 677). Additional clinical features • This diagnosis may be assigned regardless of whether biological factors related pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium are known to be etiologically related to the syndrome. • Common presentations of mental and behavioural disorders associated with pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium, without psychotic symptoms, include the following. Depressive symptoms These may include depressed mood, excessive crying; difficulty bonding with the baby; withdrawing from family and friends; loss of appetite or eating much more than usual; inability to sleep (insomnia) or sleeping too much; overwhelming fatigue or loss of energy; reduced interest and pleasure in usually enjoyable activities, intense irritability and anger; fears of not being a good mother, feelings of worthlessness, shame, guilt or inadequacy; diminished ability to think clearly, concentrate or make decisions; thoughts of harming oneself or the baby.
