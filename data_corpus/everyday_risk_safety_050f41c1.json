In such cases, corroborative evidence may be required from a knowledgeable informant or physician who has conducted a physical examination of the individual. • In some cases, individuals may be persistently preoccupied with one or more perceived defects or flaws in appearance, or ugliness in general, of another person – generally a child or a romantic partner – that is either unnoticeable or only slightly noticeable to others. This phenomenon is often referred to as “body dysmorphic disorder by proxy”. If the other diagnostic requirements for the disorder are met with reference to the perceived bodily flaws or defects of the other person (e.g. excessive self-consciousness, repetitive and excessive examination or checking, marked camouflaging or alteration of the perceived defect, avoidance of relevant social situations or triggers, distress or functional impairment), a diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder may be assigned to the individual experiencing the preoccupation. Boundary with normality (threshold) • Body-image concerns are common in many cultures, especially during adolescence. Body dysmorphic disorder is differentiated from body dissatisfaction or body-image concerns by the degree of preoccupation and frequency of related recurrent behaviours performed, as well as the degree of distress or interference the individual experiences as a consequence of these symptoms. Course features • The onset of body dysmorphic disorder commonly occurs during adolescence, with two thirds of individuals reporting onset before the age of 18 years. Subclinical symptoms may appear during early adolescence (at 12 or 13 years of age). • Although the typical course of body dysmorphic disorder involves a gradual worsening of symptoms from subclinical to full symptomatic presentation, some individuals may experience an acute onset of symptoms. • Among individuals with onset before the age of 18 years, body dysmorphic disorder is associated with gradual onset of symptoms and co-occurring disorders. These individuals are also at greater risk of attempting suicide. • Body dysmorphic disorder is generally considered a chronic disorder. Developmental presentations • Notwithstanding a relatively early age of onset of body dysmorphic disorder, it typically takes 10–15 years before affected individuals seek help. New onset may occur among older adults, although research with this age group is very limited.
