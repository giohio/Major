Boundary with generalized anxiety disorder Generalized anxiety disorder and dysthymic disorder can share several features, such as somatic symptoms of anxiety, difficulty with concentration, sleep disruption and feelings of dread associated with pessimistic thoughts. Dysthymic disorder is differentiated by the presence of low mood or loss of pleasure in previously enjoyable activities and other characteristic symptoms of dysthymic disorder (e.g. appetite changes, feelings of worthlessness, recurrent thoughts of death). In generalized anxiety disorder, individuals are focused on potential negative outcomes that might occur in a variety of everyday aspects of life (e.g. family, finances, work) rather than thoughts of worthlessness or hopelessness. Rumination often occurs in the context of dysthymic disorder but, unlike in generalized anxiety disorder, is not usually accompanied by persistent worry and apprehension about various everyday aspects of life. Generalized anxiety disorder may co-occur with dysthymic disorder, but should only be diagnosed if the diagnostic requirements for generalized anxiety disorder were met prior to the onset of dysthymic disorder. Boundary with oppositional defiant disorder It is common – particularly in children and adolescents – for patterns of noncompliance and symptoms of irritability/anger to arise as part of mood disturbance. Specifically, noncompliance may result from a number of depressive symptoms (e.g. diminished interest or pleasure in activities, difficulty concentrating, hopelessness, psychomotor retardation, reduced energy). When the behaviour problems occur primarily in the context of mood disturbance, a separate diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder should not be assigned. Boundary with secondary mood syndrome A chronic depressive syndrome that is a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. hypothyroidism) should be diagnosed as secondary mood syndrome rather than dysthymic disorder. Boundary with substance-induced mood disorder A chronic depressive syndrome due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (e.g. benzodiazepines) – including withdrawal effects (e.g. from stimulants) – should be diagnosed as substance-induced mood disorder rather than dysthymic disorder. 6A73 Mixed depressive and anxiety disorder Essential",
