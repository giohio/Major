Additional clinical features • Furthermore, excoriation disorder commonly co-occurs with depressive and anxiety symptoms, obsessive-compulsive disorder and other body-focused repetitive behaviours (e.g. nail biting). • The most commonly picked sites are the face, arms and hands, but many individuals pick from multiple body sites. Individuals may pick at healthy skin, at minor skin irregularities, at lesions such as pimples or calluses, or at scabs from previous picking. Most individuals pick with their fingernails, although a substantial minority use tweezers, knives or other objects. The essential features emphasize that skin picking must lead to skin lesions. However, individuals with this disorder often attempt to conceal or camouflage evidence of skin picking (e.g. using makeup or clothing). Therefore, careful assessment including information from collateral sources may be required to ascertain the presence of excoriation disorder symptomatology. • Individuals with excoriation disorder often spend significant amounts of time on their behaviour – sometimes several hours each day. Skin picking may endure for months or years before coming to clinical attention. • Excoriation disorder often presents with rituals surrounding the skin such as visually or tactilely examining the skin, orally manipulating or eating the skin or scab after it has been picked. • Skin-picking behaviour is associated with a variety of reported effects, including regulation of affect and arousal, tension reduction and promotion of pleasure, which presumably reinforce these behaviours. However, in the aftermath of skin picking, many individuals report a variety of negative affective states, such as a sense of loss of control or shame. Individuals with excoriation disorder report varying degrees of awareness of their skin- picking behaviour. • Excoriation disorder commonly co-occurs with trichotillomania. Boundary with normality (threshold) • Occasional picking of one’s skin (e.g. scabs, cuticles or acne) is normal and done by most people at some time in their lives. Some individuals bite their cuticles or surrounding skin; these behaviours do not qualify for a diagnosis of excoriation (skin-picking) disorder. Excoriation disorder involves recurrent picking and is associated with significant distress or impairment, which are not present in occasional, normal skin picking.
