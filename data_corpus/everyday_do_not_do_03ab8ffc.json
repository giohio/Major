Limited or typical prosocial emotions in individuals with oppositional defiant disorder or conduct-dissocial disorder can be specified as follows. 6C9x.y0 with limited prosocial emotions • In the context of a diagnosis of disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders, this specifier represents the presence of a characteristic social-emotional pattern in which several of the following features are repeatedly manifested: • limited or absent empathy or sensitivity to others’ feelings or concern for their distress – the individual is more concerned with how events and their own behaviours affect themselves than with how they affect others, even if they cause harm; • limited or absent remorse, shame or guilt over their own behaviour (unless prompted by being apprehended), lack of concern about the consequences of their actions on others and relative indifference towards the probability of punishment; • limited or absent concern over poor/problematic performance in school, work or other important activities – the individual putting forth little effort and blaming others for their poor performance; • limited or shallow expression of emotions, particularly positive or loving feelings towards others – the individual’s emotional expression possibly appearing shallow, superficial, insincere or instrumental. • This pattern is pervasive across situations and relationships (i.e. the specifier should not be applied based on a single characteristic, a single relationship or a single instance of behaviour). • The pattern is persistent over time (e.g. at least 1 year). • Among individuals with oppositional defiant disorder, those with limited prosocial emotions tend to display a particularly extreme and stable pattern of oppositional behaviours. • Among individuals with conduct-dissocial disorder, those with limited prosocial emotions tend to display a particularly severe, aggressive and stable pattern of antisocial behaviours. 6C9x.y1 with typical prosocial emotions • In the context of a diagnosis of disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders, this specifier represents a more common pattern of oppositional defiant disorder or conduct-dissocial disorder that is not characterized by the features of limited prosocial emotions. • Although some features similar to limited prosocial emotions (e.g. low concern, limited remorse) may be evident at times, they are generally infrequent, transitory and less pronounced, and do not represent a persistent pervasive pattern of social-emotional deficits. • Most individuals with disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders exhibit typical prosocial emotions.
