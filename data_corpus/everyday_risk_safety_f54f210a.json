If other diagnostic requirements are met (e.g. marked distress or significant risk of injury or death), a masochistic paraphilic arousal pattern may be a part of the basis for diagnosis of paraphilic disorder involving solitary behaviour or consenting individuals. Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis) Boundary with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder Both paraphilic disorder involving solitary behaviour or consenting individuals and compulsive sexual behaviour disorder may involve repetitive sexual impulses, urges or behaviours that result in marked distress or impairment. Paraphilic disorder involving solitary behaviour or consenting individuals is characterized by sexual impulses, urges or behaviours that are manifestations of a sustained, focused and intense pattern of atypical sexual arousal that is associated with either marked distress or significant risk of injury or death. In contrast, compulsive sexual behaviour disorder is characterized by a persistent pattern of failure to control sexual impulses, urges or behaviours, regardless of the focus of sexual arousal. If an individual with paraphilic disorder involving solitary behaviour or consenting individuals is able to exercise some degree of control over the behavioural expressions of the arousal pattern, an additional diagnosis of compulsive sexual behavioural disorder is generally not warranted. Boundary with disorders due to substance use Episodes of sexual behaviour that are atypical for the individual may occur during substance intoxication. Such episodes may not be a manifestation of a sustained, focused and intense sexual arousal pattern. At the same time, some individuals with paraphilic disorders may use substances with the intention of engaging atypical sexual behaviour that does reflect an underlying paraphilic arousal pattern. A diagnosis of paraphilic disorder involving solitary behaviour or consenting individuals may be assigned together with a disorder due to substance use if the diagnostic requirements for both are met. Boundary with other mental disorders in the context of rejection or feared rejection If distress related to rejection or feared rejection of the arousal pattern by others has reached a point that presenting symptoms meet the diagnostic requirements for another mental disorder (e.g. adjustment disorder, a depressive disorder, an anxiety or fear-related disorder), that diagnosis should be assigned rather than paraphilic disorder involving solitary behaviour or consenting individuals.
