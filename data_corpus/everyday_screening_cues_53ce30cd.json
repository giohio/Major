Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis) Boundary with schizophrenia Both schizophrenia and delusional disorder may be characterized by persistent delusions. If other features are present that meet the diagnostic requirements for schizophrenia (i.e. persistent hallucinations, disorganized thinking, negative symptoms, disorganized or abnormal psychomotor behaviour, or experiences of influence, passivity or control), a diagnosis of schizophrenia may be made instead of a diagnosis of delusional disorder. However, hallucinations that are consistent with the content of the delusions and do not occur persistently (i.e. with regular frequency for 1 month or longer) are consistent with a diagnosis of delusional disorder rather than schizophrenia. Delusional disorder is generally characterized by relatively preserved personality and less deterioration and impairment in social and occupational functioning than schizophrenia, and individuals with delusional disorder tend to present for the first time at a later age. Individuals with symptom presentations consistent with delusional disorder (e.g. delusions and related, circumscribed hallucinations) but who have not met the minimum duration requirement of 3 months should not be assigned a diagnosis of schizophrenia, even though the combination of persistent delusions and related hallucinations technically meets diagnostic requirements for schizophrenia. Instead, a diagnosis of other specified primary psychotic disorder is more appropriate in such cases. Boundary with mood disorders with psychotic symptoms In depressive disorders with psychotic symptoms and bipolar disorders with psychotic symptoms, delusions may present during the course of the mood episodes. Although mood symptoms – especially depressed mood – can occur in delusional disorder, the diagnosis of delusional disorder requires that there are times when the person experiences the delusions in the absence of any mood disturbance.
