  "text_en": "Neurodevelopmental disorders 137 Course features • Deficits in reading, mathematics and written expression identified in childhood typically persist through adolescence and into adulthood. These deficits may negatively affect a child’s academic achievement, increase the likelihood of school dropout, and contribute to unemployment (or underemployment) in adulthood – particularly if left untreated. Along with school dropout, significant co-occurring depressive symptoms increase the risk of poor mental health outcomes, including suicide. • The specific impairments associated with developmental learning disorder vary with developmental stage and learning abilities, severity of deficits, complexity of tasks, presence of co-occurring mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders, and the availability of support. • Developmental learning disorder is also associated with heightened risk of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts across the lifespan. Developmental presentations • Developmental learning disorder is most often diagnosed during elementary school years because difficulties in reading, mathematics and/or writing typically only become evident when these topics are taught formally. Some individuals, however, may not be diagnosed until later in development, including in adulthood. Premorbid impairments, such as in language, counting or rhyming, or fine motor control tend to be evident in early childhood prior to the diagnosis of developmental learning disorder. • The prevalence of developmental learning disorder across all areas of impairment (i.e. reading, written expression and mathematics) is estimated to affect between 5% and 15% of school-aged children. Prevalence among adults is unknown, but is estimated at approximately 4%. The prevalence of developmental learning disorder for specific academic areas among school-aged children is variable (reading is estimated at 5–17%; mathematics at 6–7%; written expression at 7–15%). • Children with developmental learning disorder frequently exhibit co-occurring symptoms of depressive disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders, and externalizing behaviour disorders, which may make it more difficult to assess their learning impairments. • Children with developmental learning disorder with impairment in one academic area are more likely to have co-occurring impairments in other areas. Culture-related features • Developmental learning disorder with impairment in reading can be manifested differently by language. For example, in English, the presentation involves inaccurate and slow reading of single words. In other languages with more direct mapping between sounds and letters (e.g. Spanish, German) and non-alphabetic languages (e.g. Chinese, Japanese), the typical presentation is slow but accurate reading.
