Secondary parenting The ICD-11 classification is divided into 25 chapters, generally based on organ system (e.g. diseases of the digestive system), anatomic location (e.g. diseases of the ear and mastoid process), common pathophysiological process (e.g. certain infectious or parasitic disorders; neoplasms) or medical specialty (e.g. separating diseases of the nervous system from mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders). Many diseases in ICD-11 could have been placed in more than one chapter (e.g. pancreatic cancer could have been plausibly placed in either the diseases of the digestive system or the neoplasms chapter). ICD-11 acknowledges this fact by sometimes locating the same disorder in two (or more) chapters, with one of the chapters considered to be the “primary parent” and other chapter(s) termed “secondary parent(s)”. For example, the grouping of primary tics and tic disorders is listed in both Chapter 8 on diseases of the nervous system (within the movement disorders grouping) and the mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders chapter (within the neurodevelopmental disorders grouping). They are primary-parented in Chapter 8 on diseases of the nervous system and secondary-parented in the mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders chapter. The code number in both instances is the same and corresponds to the primary parent. For example, the code for Tourette syndrome is 8A05.00. The “8” in the first digit of the code indicates that it is primary-parented in Chapter 8 on diseases of the nervous system. The same code (8A05.00) is retained when Tourette syndrome appears as a part of the grouping of neurodevelopmental disorders in Chapter 6. 34 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders",
