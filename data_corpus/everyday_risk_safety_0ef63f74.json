In children under 5 years of age, attachment disturbances related to maltreatment may also include reactive attachment disorder or disinhibited social engagement disorder, which can co-occur with complex post-traumatic stress disorder. • Children and adolescents with complex post-traumatic stress disorder often report symptoms consistent with depressive disorders, eating and feeding disorders, sleep- wake disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct-dissocial disorder and separation anxiety disorder. The relationship of traumatic experiences to the onset of symptoms can be useful in establishing a differential diagnosis. At the same time, other mental disorders can also develop following extremely stressful or traumatic experiences. Additional co-occurring diagnoses should only be made if the symptoms are not fully accounted for by complex post-traumatic stress disorder, and all diagnostic requirements for each disorder are met. • In older adults, complex post-traumatic stress disorder may be dominated by anxious avoidance of thoughts, feelings, memories and people, as well as physiological symptoms of anxiety (e.g. enhanced startle reaction, autonomic hyper-reactivity). Affected individuals may experience intense regret related to the impact of traumatic experiences on their lives. Culture-related features • Cultural variation exists in the expression of symptoms of complex post-traumatic stress disorder. For example, somatic or dissociative symptoms may be more prominent in certain groups, attributable to cultural interpretations of the psychological, physiological and spiritual etiology of these symptoms and of high levels of arousal. • Given the severe, prolonged or recurrent nature of the traumatic events that precipitate complex post-traumatic stress disorder, collective suffering and the destruction of social bonds, networks and communities may present as a focal concern or as important related features of the disorder. • For migrant communities – especially refugees or asylum seekers – complex post-traumatic stress disorder may be exacerbated by acculturative stressors and the social environment in the host country.
