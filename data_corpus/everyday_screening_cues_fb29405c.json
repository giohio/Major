Boundary of catatonia associated with another mental disorder with psychomotor retardation in depressive or mixed episodes Psychomotor retardation in depressive episodes and decreased psychomotor activity in catatonia can manifest in similar ways. In the presence of a depressive or mixed episode, an additional diagnosis of catatonia associated with another mental disorder is appropriate if symptoms of increased psychomotor activity or abnormal psychomotor activity are also present. If all catatonia symptoms are from the decreased psychomotor activity cluster, whether or not an additional diagnosis of catatonia associated with another mental disorder is assigned is a clinical judgement based on the severity of the symptoms and on whether catatonia is a specific focus of clinical attention. Boundary of catatonia associated with another mental disorder with psychomotor agitation in depressive, manic or mixed episodes Psychomotor agitation in a mood episode and increased psychomotor activity in catatonia can manifest in similar ways. In the presence of a mood episode, an additional diagnosis of catatonia associated with another mental disorder is only appropriate if symptoms of decreased psychomotor activity or abnormal psychomotor activity are also present. If all catatonia symptoms are aspects of increased psychomotor activity, an additional diagnosis of catatonia is not warranted.
