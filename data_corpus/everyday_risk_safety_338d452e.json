For example, in some groups anger may be the most prominent symptom related to traumatic exposure, and the most culturally appropriate way of expressing distress. In other cultural contexts, nightmares may have elaborate cultural significance that increases their importance in assessing for the characteristic symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. • Symptoms central to post-traumatic stress disorder in some cultures may not be included in descriptions of the disorder, and may therefore be missed by clinicians unfamiliar with those cultural expressions. For example, somatic symptoms such as headaches (often with visual aura), dizziness, bodily heat, shortness of breath, gastrointestinal distress, trembling and orthostatic hypotension may be prominent. • Cultural variation may affect post-traumatic stress disorder onset and the meaning of traumatic stressors. For example, some cultural groups attribute greater risk of post- traumatic stress disorder to traumatic events affecting family members than those affecting the person themselves; other societies may find it particularly traumatic to observe the desecration or destruction of religious symbols or to be denied the ability to perform funeral rites for deceased relatives. • Certain trauma-related symptoms may be associated with intense fear in particular cultural contexts owing to their connection with specific catastrophic cognitions, and may precipitate panic attacks in the context of post-traumatic stress disorder. These catastrophic interpretations may affect the trajectory of the disorder, and may be associated with greater severity, chronicity or poorer response to treatment. For example, some Latin American patients may consider trauma-related trembling to be the precursor of a lifelong condition of severe nervios (nerves), and some Cambodians may interpret palpitations as signs of a “weak heart”. • Some post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may not be viewed as pathological in some cultural groups. For example, intrusive thoughts may be considered normal rather than a symptom indicating illness. It is important to evaluate the presence of all required diagnostic elements, including functional impairment, rather than treating any one symptom as pathognomic. Sex- and/or gender-related features • Post-traumatic stress disorder is more common among females. • Females diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder are more likely to experience a longer duration of impairment and higher levels of negative emotionality and somatic symptoms as a part of their clinical presentation.
