If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort. Insight specifiers Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder vary in the degree of insight they have about the accuracy of the beliefs that underlie their symptoms. Although many can acknowledge that their thoughts or behaviours are untrue or excessive, some cannot, and the beliefs of some individuals with body dysmorphic disorder may at times appear to be delusional in the degree of conviction or fixity with which these beliefs are held (e.g. an individual is convinced that others think they are hideously ugly). Insight may vary substantially even over short periods of time – for example, depending on the level of current anxiety or distress – and should be assessed with respect to a time period that is sufficient to allow for such fluctuation (e.g. a few days or a week). The degree of insight that an individual exhibits in the context of body dysmorphic disorder can be specified as follows.
