As a basis for appropriate management, it is important to evaluate in such cases whether the symptoms are secondary to the medical condition or are more indicative of comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 6A06 Stereotyped movement disorder Essential (required) features • The persistent (e.g. lasting for several months) presence of voluntary, repetitive, stereotyped, apparently purposeless and often rhythmic movements (e.g. body rocking, hand flapping, head banging, eye poking and hand biting) that are not caused by the direct physiological effects of a substance or medication (including withdrawal) is required for diagnosis. Neurodevelopmental disorders | Stereotyped movement disorder 150 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders • Stereotyped movements result in significant interference with the ability to engage in normal daily activities, or result in self-inflicted bodily injury severe enough to be an independent focus of clinical attention or that would result in self-injury if protective measures were not taken. • Onset occurs during the developmental period, typically at an early age. Specifiers related to self-injury A specifier should be applied with the diagnosis of stereotyped movement disorder to indicate whether it involves movements that result in physical harm to the individual. 6A06.0 Stereotyped movement disorder without self-injury • Stereotyped movements do not result in physical harm to the affected individual even without the presence of protective measures. These behaviours typically include body rocking, head rocking, finger-flicking mannerisms and hand flapping. 6A06.1 Stereotyped movement disorder with self-injury • Stereotyped movements result in harm to the affected individual that is severe enough to be an independent focus of clinical attention, or would result in self-injury if protective measures (e.g. helmet to prevent head injury) were not taken. These behaviours typically include head banging, face slapping, eye poking and biting of the hands, lips or other body parts. 6A06.Z Stereotyped movement disorder, unspecified Additional clinical features • Co-occurrence of stereotyped movement disorder and disorders of intellectual development is common.
