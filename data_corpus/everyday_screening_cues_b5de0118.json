Additional clinical features • A hypomanic syndrome arising during antidepressant treatment (medication, electroconvulsive therapy, light therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation) should be considered a hypomanic episode if the syndrome persists after the treatment is discontinued and the full diagnostic requirements of a hypomanic episode are met after the direct physiological effects of the treatment are likely to have receded. Boundary with normality (threshold) • Hypomanic episodes are often difficult to distinguish from normal periods of elevated mood – for example, related to positive life events – particularly given that hypomanic episodes are not associated with significant functional impairment. In order to be considered a hypomanic episode, the symptoms must represent a significant and noticeable change from the individual’s typical mood and behaviour. • The occurrence of one or more hypomanic episodes in the absence of a history of other types of mood episodes (manic, depressive or mixed episodes) is not a sufficient basis for a diagnosis of a mood disorder. Developmental presentations • As in adults, hypomanic episodes in children and adolescents are similar to – but less severe than – manic episodes, and may present for a shorter period of time.
