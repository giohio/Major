This will be useful, for example, in settings where there has been a shift to use of ICD-11 for clinical purposes, but where data or health reporting systems are still in transition and require the use of ICD-10 codes. Use of this table assumes that the clinician has already made their diagnosis according to the ICD-11 CDDR. This table is not valid for mapping categories from the ICD-10 mental and behavioural disorders to ICD-11 because it does not reflect the full content of the ICD-10 mental and behavioural disorders. This crosswalk is not intended for use in health statistics or in the coding of medical records because, in a substantial number of instances, selecting among multiple possible ICD-10 categories depends on clinical information that will not be available in those contexts.
