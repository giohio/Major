Additional clinical features • Manic episodes may or may not include psychotic symptoms. A wide variety of psychotic symptoms may occur in mania; among the most common are grandiose delusions (e.g. being chosen by God, having special powers or abilities), persecutory delusions and self-referential delusions (e.g. being conspired against because of one’s special identity or abilities). Delusions related to experiences of influence, passivity or control (e.g. the experience that thoughts or actions are not generated by oneself, are being placed in one’s mind or withdrawn from one’s mind by others, or that one’s thoughts are being broadcast to others) may also occur. Hallucinations are less frequent, and commonly accompany delusions of persecution or reference. They are usually auditory (e.g. adulatory voices), and less commonly visual (e.g. visions of deities), somatic or tactile. • Some patients may exhibit symptoms or impairment in functioning that is sufficiently severe to require immediate intervention (e.g. treatment with mood-stabilizing medications). As a result, their symptoms may not meet the full duration requirement of a manic episode. Episodes that meet the full symptom requirements but last for less than 1 week because they are shortened by a treatment intervention should still be considered manic episodes. • A manic syndrome arising during antidepressant treatment (e.g. medication, electroconvulsive therapy, light therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation) should be considered a manic episode if the syndrome persists after the treatment is discontinued and the full diagnostic requirements of a manic episode are met after the direct physiological effects of the treatment are likely to have receded.
