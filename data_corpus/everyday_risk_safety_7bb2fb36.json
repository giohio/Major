The rates of co-occurrence are influenced by sociocultural variation in availability of substances. Sex- and/or gender-related features • Conduct-dissocial disorder is more common among males. • Males with conduct-dissocial disorder are more likely to exhibit symptoms of stealing, vandalism, fighting and school discipline problems, whereas females are more likely to exhibit lying, truancy, substance abuse, absconding and prostitution. • Males with conduct-dissocial disorder more commonly exhibit both physical and relational aggression, whereas females are more likely to exclusively exhibit relational aggression. Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis) Boundary with oppositional defiant disorder For a diagnosis of conduct-dissocial disorder to be assigned, the pattern of behaviour must be severe and dissocial (i.e. violating major rules, norms, or the rights of others), such that it extends beyond the noncompliant and defiant behaviours that are characteristic of oppositional defiant disorder. However, oppositional defiant disorder and conduct-dissocial disorder frequently co- occur, particularly among adolescents and individuals with a more persistent history of behaviour problems, and may be diagnosed together if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met. Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may exhibit disruptive behaviours as a result of their impulsivity or hyperactivity; however, these disruptive behaviours are not typically severe and dissocial in nature (i.e. they do not violate major rules, norms or the rights of others), and therefore would not warrant an additional diagnosis of conduct-dissocial disorder. However, conduct-dissocial disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder can co-occur, and both may be diagnosed if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met. Boundary with mood disorders Conduct problems, aggressive behaviours, risky behaviours and irritability/anger can occur in the context of mood episodes (depressive, manic, mixed or hypomanic). Moreover, in children and adolescents, depressive, manic or hypomanic mood can manifest as irritability. When the behaviour problems occur entirely in the context of mood episodes, a separate diagnosis of conduct-dissocial disorder is generally not warranted. Boundary with intermittent explosive disorder Individuals with intermittent explosive disorder may come into conflict with other people and the law because of their explosive outbursts, but these episodes do not constitute a more general pattern of antisocial behaviour characteristic of conduct-dissocial disorder (e.g. rule violations, Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders | Conduct-dissocial disorder",
