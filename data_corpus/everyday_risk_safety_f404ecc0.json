  "text_en": "120 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders Additional clinical features • In typical development, understanding and production of the different components of language are tightly correlated and develop in tandem. In developmental language disorder, this developmental relationship may be out of step, with differential impairment in any of the component language skills. • Many children with developmental language disorder exhibit a discrepancy between verbal and nonverbal ability, but this is not a requirement for diagnosis. • Developmental language disorder frequently co-occurs with other neurodevelopmental disorders, such as developmental speech sound disorder, developmental learning disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder and developmental motor coordination disorder. • Developmental language disorder is often associated with difficulties in peer relationships, emotional disturbance and disruptive behaviours, particularly in school-aged children. • Developmental language disorder often runs in families. • Developmental language disorder can be a presenting feature in some individuals with specific chromosomal anomalies, including sex chromosome anomalies. Where available, chromosome testing can assist in identifying other health risks associated with specific underlying chromosomal abnormalities. If a specific chromosomal or other developmental anomaly is identified, this should be diagnosed in addition to the developmental language disorder. • Regression of language skills once acquired is not a feature of developmental language disorder. Reported loss of early first words in the second year of life associated with a decline in social and communication behaviours – and, more rarely, loss of language skills after 3 years of age – may be a presentation of autism spectrum disorder. Language abilities may also be lost due to diseases of the nervous system including acquired brain injury from stroke, trauma or encephalopathy with or without overt epilepsy. Concomitant loss of physical skills with language abilities may be indicative of a neurodegenerative condition. When an underlying neurological cause has been identified, the condition should not be diagnosed as developmental language disorder but rather as secondary speech or language syndrome, which should be assigned in addition to the appropriate diagnosis for the underlying condition. Boundary with normality (threshold) • Children vary widely in the age at which they first acquire spoken language and in the pace at which language skills become firmly established. The majority of preschool-aged children who acquire speech later than expected go on to develop normal language abilities. Very early delays in language acquisition are therefore not indicative of developmental language disorder. However, the",
