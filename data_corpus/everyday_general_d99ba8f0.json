Neurodevelopmental disorders | Developmental speech and language disorders Neurodevelopmental disorders 119 Specifiers for areas of language impairment The main areas of language ability currently affected in developmental language disorders should be characterized using one of the following specifiers, although these may vary over time: 6A01.20 Developmental language disorder with impairment of receptive and expressive language • This specifier should be applied when the ability to learn and understand spoken or signed language (i.e. receptive language) is markedly below the expected level for the individual’s age, and is accompanied by persistent impairment in the ability to produce and use spoken or signed language (i.e. expressive language). 6A01.21 Developmental language disorder with impairment of mainly expressive language • This specifier should be applied when the ability to produce and use spoken or signed language (i.e. expressive language) is markedly below the expected level for the individual’s age, but the ability to understand spoken or signed language (i.e. receptive language) is relatively intact. 6A01.22 Developmental language disorder with impairment of mainly pragmatic language • This specifier should be applied when the developmental language disorder is characterized by persistent and substantial difficulties with the understanding and use of language in social contexts – for example, making inferences, understanding verbal humour and resolving ambiguous meaning. Receptive and expressive language skills are relatively unimpaired, but pragmatic language abilities are markedly below the expected level for the individual’s age, and interfere with functional communication to a greater degree than with other components of language (e.g. syntax, semantics). This specifier should not be used if the pragmatic language impairment occurs in the context of a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. 6A01.23 Developmental language disorder with other specified language impairment • This specifier should be applied if the developmental language disorder meets all the diagnostic requirements of the disorder but the pattern of deficits in language is not adequately characterized by one of the other available specifiers.
