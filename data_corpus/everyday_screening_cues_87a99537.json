Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders 329 Developmental presentations • Onset of trichotillomania is bimodal, with a peak during early childhood and one during early adolescence. • Hair-pulling behaviour in infancy (before 2 years of age) is relatively common, with most individuals ceasing to engage in the behaviour by early childhood. However, many adults reporting a chronic history of trichotillomania describe early childhood onset. Whether onset in early childhood (compared to onset in adolescence) presents as a distinct subtype of the disorder, or what factors may contribute to persistence, is therefore unknown. • Onset is most common in early adolescence, coinciding with puberty. Adolescent onset is associated with greater chronicity and impairment. Prevalence rates among adolescents are similar to those among adults (approximately 1–2% of the general population). • Children and adolescents engage more frequently in automatic hair pulling; that is, they engage in the behaviour outside awareness. Focused, intentional hair pulling – often preceded by intense urges and followed by relief – is more common among adolescents and adults. • The negative impact of hair pulling appears to become more severe across developmental periods. Children under the age of 10 years appear to experience less academic impact than older children and adolescents, who tend to report more difficulties in school attendance and academic performance as a result of hair pulling. • As with adults, children and adolescents with trichotillomania appear to have high rates of co-occurring mental health disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive- compulsive disorder, excoriation (skin-picking) disorder, other body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders and depressive disorders. Children and adolescents may also be more likely to present with co-occurring attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Sex- and/or gender-related features • Prevalence rates appear to be equal among girls and boys in childhood, although female adolescents and adults are more commonly diagnosed. • Although there is no evidence for gender differences in course and symptom presentation, men are more likely to experience a co-occurring anxiety or fear-related disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder. • Focused hair pulling in women often increases during puberty and at other times of hormonal fluctuations during adulthood (e.g. menstruation, perimenopause).
