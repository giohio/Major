Disorders specifically associated with stress | Disinhibited social engagement disorder Disorders specifically associated with stress 359 • Children with a history of grossly insufficient care are at increased risk of developing disinhibited social engagement disorder – particularly when it occurs very early (e.g. prior to the age of 2 years). However, disinhibited social engagement disorder is rare, and most children with such a history do not develop the disorder. • In contrast to reactive attachment disorder, symptoms of disinhibited social engagement disorder tend to be more persistent following the provision of appropriate care, even with the development of selective attachments. • Children with disinhibited social engagement disorder related to repetitive maltreatment (e.g. chronic physical or sexual abuse) are at risk of developing co-occurring post-traumatic stress disorder or complex post-traumatic stress disorder. • General impulsivity is commonly associated with disinhibited social engagement disorder, particularly among older children, and there is a high rate of co-occurrence with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Boundary with normality (threshold) • Children vary greatly in their temperamental features, and disinhibited social engagement disorder should be distinguished from the ebullience associated with an outgoing temperamental style. Distinguishing features of the disinhibited social engagement disorder are the dysfunctional nature of the behaviour and its association with a history of grossly insufficient care. Course features • Disinhibited social engagement disorder is moderately stable, and symptoms may persist throughout childhood and adolescence. Overly friendly behaviour appears to be relatively resistant to change. • Individuals with disinhibited social engagement disorder who lived in institutions for an extended period of time appear to be at greatest risk of persistent symptoms, even after adoption. Early removal from an adverse environment decreases the likelihood that indiscriminate social behaviours will persist. Only some individuals with disinhibited social engagement disorder appear to respond to interventions targeting enhancement of caregiving. • In adolescence, individuals with a history of disinhibited social engagement disorder demonstrate superficial peer relationships (e.g. identification of acquaintances as close friends) and other deficits in social functioning (e.g. increased conflict with peers). • During childhood, disinhibited social engagement disorder often manifests in violation of socially appropriate physical (e.g. seeking comfort from unfamiliar adults) and verbal boundaries (e.g. asking inappropriate questions to unfamiliar adults).
