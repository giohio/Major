These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, the following: • palpitations or increased heart rate • sweating • trembling • sensations of shortness of breath • feelings of choking • chest pain • nausea or abdominal distress • feelings of dizziness or lightheadedness • chills or hot flushes • tingling or lack of sensation in extremities (i.e. paraesthesias) • depersonalization or derealization • fear of losing control or going mad • fear of imminent death. • At least some of the panic attacks are unexpected – that is, they are not restricted to particular stimuli or situations but rather seem to arise “out of the blue”. • Panic attacks are followed by persistent concern or worry (e.g. for several weeks) about their recurrence or their perceived negative significance (e.g. that the physiological symptoms may be those of a myocardial infarction), or by behaviours intended to avoid their recurrence (e.g. only leaving the home with a trusted companion). • Panic attacks are not limited to anxiety-provoking situations in the context of another mental disorder. • The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. pheochromocytoma), and are not due to the direct effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (e.g. coffee, cocaine), including withdrawal effects (e.g. alcohol, benzodiazepines). • The symptoms result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort. Note: panic attacks can occur in other anxiety and fear-related disorders and in other mental disorders; therefore, the presence of panic attacks is not in itself sufficient to assign a diagnosis of panic disorder.
