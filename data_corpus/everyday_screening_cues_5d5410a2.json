Additional clinical features • Tourette syndrome frequently co-occurs with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and impulsivity, disinhibition, anxiety and immature behaviour may be associated features of both diagnoses. • Motor and phonic tics in Tourette syndrome may be voluntarily suppressed for short periods of time, may be exacerbated by stress, and may diminish during sleep or during periods of focused enjoyable activity. • Tics are often highly suggestible – for example, when an individual with Tourette syndrome is asked about specific symptoms, old tics that have been absent for some time may transiently reappear.

Neurodevelopmental disorders | Secondary-parented categories in neurodevelopmental disorders Neurodevelopmental disorders 155 Course features • The onset of Tourette syndrome commonly occurs during childhood (between the ages of 4 and 6 years), with peak symptom severity occurring between the ages of 8 and 12 years. Across adolescence, there is decreasing likelihood of onset. Onset during adulthood is rare and most often associated with severe psychosocial stressors, use of specific drugs (e.g. cocaine) or an insult to the central nervous system (e.g. post-viral encephalitis). • The onset of Tourette syndrome is typically",
