This Advisory Group was tasked with scientific oversight for the entire revision process. Its specific functions were to advise WHO on the key guiding principles and goals of the revision, the steps involved in the revision, and identification of other groups of relevant consultants and stakeholders required to develop the classification of mental disorders and other relevant parts of ICD-11; and to facilitate the implementation of global field studies to assess and improve the revisions to ICD-11 and the CDDR. The Advisory Group also functioned as one of approximately 30 topic advisory groups for the overall development of ICD-11, each focusing on a different area or cross-cutting theme (e.g. gastroenterology, ophthalmology, quality and safety) and represented on the Revision Steering Committee – working with the WHO Classifications and Terminology and Data Standards Team responsible for coordinating the overall effort. Development of the CDDR by ICD-11 working groups The International Advisory Group advised the WHO Department of Mental Health and Substance Use on the appointment of more than a dozen working groups tasked with reviewing the relevant evidence and making proposals for changes to the structure and content of the ICD-10 classification of mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders. Most of the working groups were established in relation to a particular subset of mental disorders (e.g. psychotic disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, personality disorders). Others were appointed to make proposals regarding how cross-cutting themes (e.g. presentations in children and adolescents, presentations in older adults, cultural factors) would be handled in the CDDR. Members of the working groups were expert multidisciplinary mental health professionals with relevant scientific and/or clinical expertise. The working groups were constituted such that experts from all WHO regions were included, with substantial representation from low- and middle-income countries. The working groups’ charge included reviewing the extant body of basic science, clinical and public health research relevant to their area of responsibility for use as a basis for their recommendations for revisions to the classification of mental disorders in ICD-10. The working groups used these reviews to recommend changes to enhance the validity of ICD-11 (e.g. addition or deletion of categories, changes in thresholds or diagnostic requirements). They also reviewed available evidence related to the clinical utility of proposed changes, such as whether the revised diagnostic descriptions would enhance the identification of individuals who need mental health services or their usefulness in treatment and management decisions in a range of global health-care settings, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Working groups proposed specific changes to the structure of the classification of mental disorders in ICD-11; what categories and specifiers were included; and the MMS brief descriptions and the CDDR for the area under their purview. They were asked to provide the rationale, evidence base and expected impact on clinical utility of any proposed change via a structured, documented process (16). Working groups were instructed to emphasize considerations of clinical utility and global applicability in developing their recommendations. Clinical utility is important because health classifications represent the interface between health encounters and health information. A system that does not provide clinically useful information at the level of the health encounter will not be faithfully implemented by clinicians. In that case, data aggregated from health encounters will not be optimal and perhaps not even valid, affecting the usefulness and validity of summary health encounter data used for decision-making at the health system, national and global",
