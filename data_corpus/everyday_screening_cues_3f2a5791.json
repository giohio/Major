Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Episode of harmful psychoactive substance use 458 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders Boundary with substance intoxication Substance intoxication is defined by substance use that results in clinically significant transient substance-specific symptoms (see Table 6.15, p. 475). Recovery from substance intoxication is generally complete and without physical or mental sequelae. If there is continuing damage or harm (e.g. the effects of hypoxia, the effects of prolonged hyperactivity or inactivity, tissue damage) due to an episode of substance intoxication, a diagnosis of episode of harmful psychoactive substance use may be assigned. If relevant at the time of the clinical encounter (e.g. in emergency settings), episode of harmful psychoactive substance use may be diagnosed with an associated diagnosis of substance intoxication. Boundary with substance-induced mental disorders Substance-induced mental disorders can be associated with a single episode of substance use. If a substance-induced mental disorder has occurred as a form of harm resulting from a single episode of substance use, both episode of harmful psychoactive substance use and the relevant substance-induced mental disorder should be diagnosed (e.g. episode of harmful cocaine use with cocaine-induced psychotic disorder). Note: specific substance-induced mental disorders are only applicable for some substances or substance classes (see Table 6.14, p. 454). Boundary with overdose When ingestion of psychoactive substances results in symptoms of overdose (e.g. coma, life- threatening cardiac or respiratory suppression), a diagnosis from the grouping of harmful effects of substances in Chapter 22 on injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes should also be assigned.
