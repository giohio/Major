Impulse control disorders involve a range of specific behaviours, including fire setting, stealing, sexual behaviour and explosive aggressive outbursts. The episodes of the behaviour involved in impulse control disorders are often preceded by a rise in tension or affective arousal, which can also occur when attempting to resist the behaviour. The episodes of the behaviour are typically followed by pleasure, gratification or relief of tension. However, over the course of the disorder, individuals may report less awareness of building tension or arousal prior to the behaviour, or a reduction in pleasure or gratification following the behaviour. They may also experience feelings of guilt or shame following the behaviour. The behaviours involved in impulse control disorders are not fully attributable to another mental disorder, the direct central nervous system effects of a medication or substance – including substance intoxication and withdrawal – or another medical condition not classified under mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders. Impulse control disorders include the following: 6C70 Pyromania 6C71 Kleptomania 6C72 Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder 6C73 Intermittent explosive disorder 6C7Y Other specified impulse control disorder 6C7Z Impulse control disorder, unspecified.
