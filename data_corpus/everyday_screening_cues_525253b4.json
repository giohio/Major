In many cases, hyperactivity symptoms predominate in preschool and decrease with age, such that they are no longer prominent beyond adolescence or may instead be reported as feelings of physical restlessness. Attentional problems may be more commonly observed beginning in later childhood, especially in school and among adults in occupational settings. • The manifestations and severity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder often vary according to the characteristics and demands of the environment. Symptoms and behaviours should be evaluated across multiple types of environments as a part of clinical assessment. • Where available, teacher and parent reports should be obtained to establish the diagnosis in children and adolescents. In adults, the report of a significant other, family member or co-worker can provide important additional information. • Some individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may first present for services in adulthood. When making the diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults, a history of inattention, hyperactivity or impulsivity before 12 years of age is an important corroborating feature that can be best established from school or local records, or from informants who knew the individual during childhood. In the absence of such corroborating information, a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in older adolescents and adults should be made with caution. • In a subset of individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, especially in children, an exclusively inattentive presentation may occur. There is no hyperactivity, and the presentation is characterized by daydreaming, mind-wandering and a lack of focus. These children are sometimes referred to as exhibiting a “restrictive inattentive pattern of symptoms” or “sluggish cognitive tempo”. • In a subset of individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, combined presentation, severe inattentiveness and hyperactivity-impulsivity are both consistently present in most of the situations that an individual encounters, and are also evidenced by the clinician’s own observations. This pattern is often referred to as “hyperkinetic disorder”, and is considered a more severe form of the disorder. • Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms often significantly limit academic achievement. Adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder often find it difficult to hold down a demanding job, and may be disproportionately underemployed or unemployed. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder can also strain interpersonal relationships across the lifespan, including those with family members, peers and romantic partners. Individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder often have greater difficulty regulating their behaviour in the context of groups than in one-on-one situations. • Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder often co-occurs with other neurodevelopmental disorders, including developmental speech",
