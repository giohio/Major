The three symptoms may come from one or any combination of the following three symptom clusters. Note: symptoms that require assessment by physical examination are indicated below. Decreased psychomotor activity • Staring: fixed gaze; decreased blinking, often with widely opened eyes • Ambitendency: appearance of being “motorically stuck” in indecisive or hesitant movement • Negativism: opposing or behaving contrary to requests or instructions, which may lead to withdrawal from interaction with others (turning away) or refusal to take food or drink when offered • Stupor: immobility; no or markedly reduced psychomotor activity; minimally responsive to external stimuli • Mutism: no or very little verbal response; speech that is hushed or whispered to the point of being unintelligible (Note: do not count if speech symptoms are due to a disease of the nervous system, developmental speech or language disorder, or other disease or disorder affecting speech.) Increased psychomotor activity • Any of the following: extreme hyperactivity or agitation for no reason with nonpurposeful movements and/or uncontrollable, extreme emotional reactions; impulsivity (sudden engagement in inappropriate behaviour without provocation); combativeness (striking out against others usually in an undirected manner, with or without the potential for injury) (Note: multiple manifestations of increased psychomotor activity should only be counted as one of the required three symptoms in order to meet the requirements for catatonia.) Abnormal psychomotor activity • Grimacing: odd or distorted facial expressions; often inappropriate and irrelevant to the situation • Mannerisms: odd, purposeful movements that are not appropriate to the individual’s cultural context; exaggerated caricatures of mundane movements • Posturing: spontaneous and active maintenance of a posture against gravity; sitting or standing for long periods without reacting • Stereotypy: repetitive, non-goal-directed motor activity (e.g. finger-play, repeatedly touching, patting or rubbing self) (Note: the abnormality is not inherent in the action but relates to its frequency.) • Rigidity: resistance by way of increased muscle tone, which may range in severity from mildly increased tone to severe “lead pipe” rigidity (requires examination) • Echophenomena: mimicking examiner’s speech (echolalia) or movements (echopraxia)",
