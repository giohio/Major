Note: harm to the health of the person to whom the diagnosis applies includes injuries caused by behaviour related to intoxication (e.g. impulsive aggressive behaviour, psychomotor impairment leading to injury; see Table 6.15, p. 475), acute health problems resulting from substance use (e.g. overdose, acute gastritis, the effects of hypoxia or prolonged hyperactivity or inactivity), and exacerbation or decompensation of pre-existing chronic health problems (e.g. hypertension, liver disease or peptic ulceration). Harm may also result from a harmful route of administration (e.g. injecting drug use causing bloodborne virus infections, cocaine use causing a perforated nasal septum). The relevant diagnostic codes from other ICD-11 chapters – including Chapter 22 on injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes – should be used to describe the specific health consequences of the harmful substance use. Harm to the health of others includes any form of physical harm, including trauma (e.g. impaired driving causing a motor vehicle accident, assaultive behaviour leading to bodily harm to another person) or mental disorder (e.g. post-traumatic stress disorder arising from an assault by the intoxicated individual) that is directly attributable to behaviour due to substance intoxication on the part of the person to whom the diagnosis of episode of harmful psychoactive substance use applies. Additional clinical features • There must be explicit evidence of harm to the individual’s physical or mental health, or of substance-related behaviour due to intoxication that has led to harm to the physical or mental health of others. There must also be a clear causal relationship between the harm to health and the episode of substance use in question. • The likelihood of harm to self or others due behaviour related to intoxication varies substantially by substance (see Table 6.15, p. 475). For example, such behaviour is unlikely to arise from caffeine or nicotine intoxication. • Psychoactive substance use commonly occurs in the context of other mental disorders. An additional diagnosis of episode of harmful psychoactive substance use can be made if the index episode of substance use has resulted in clinically significant harm to the individual’s physical health, or has exacerbated or triggered an episode of a pre-existing mental disorder (e.g. a manic or depressive episode or a psychotic episode). • A diagnosis of episode of harmful psychoactive substance use often signals an opportunity for intervention – typically a low-intensity intervention that can be implemented in a wide range of settings, which is specifically aimed at reducing the likelihood of additional harmful episodes or of progression to harmful pattern of use or substance dependence. • A diagnosis of episode of harmful psychoactive substance use of unknown or unspecified psychoactive substances can be assigned if the substance consumed is initially unknown. As more information becomes available (e.g. laboratory results, report from a collateral informant) the diagnosis should be changed to indicate the substance responsible for the episode of harm. • As more information becomes available",
