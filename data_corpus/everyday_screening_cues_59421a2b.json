  "text_en": "convictions of the importance of acquiring and retaining items may at times appear to be delusional in the degree of conviction or fixity with which these beliefs are held (see insight specifiers, p. 322). If these beliefs are restricted to the fear of discarding items or conviction that items have a special importance despite objective evidence to the contrary without a history of other delusions – that is, these beliefs occur entirely in the context of symptomatic episodes of hoarding disorder and are fully consistent with the other clinical features of the disorder – hoarding disorder should be diagnosed instead of delusional disorder. Individuals with hoarding disorder do not exhibit other features of psychosis (e.g. hallucinations or formal thought disorder). Boundary with mood disorders Unlike individuals with hoarding disorder, those with mood disorders may exhibit hoarding secondary to depressive or manic symptomatology. In the case of depressive disorders, decreased energy, lack of initiative or apathy may lead to object accumulation, which – unlike hoarding disorder – is done without any intention or purpose. Furthermore, individuals with depressive disorders may be indifferent to hoarding objects, and display no distress associated with discarding them. In the case of bipolar disorders, object accumulation may be secondary to excessive buying that can occur during manic episodes. However, those with bipolar disorders do not have difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, and only very rarely are manic episodes of sufficient duration to allow for a substantial amount of clutter to develop in the home. Boundary with feeding and eating disorders Some individuals diagnosed with feeding and eating disorders may accumulate large quantities of food to allow for binge eating in specific situations (e.g. while at home alone). However, in contrast to hoarding disorder, the purpose of accumulation is restricted to the consumption of food. Concerns about being or becoming overweight and body-image distortions are not present in hoarding disorder. Boundary with dementia Some individuals with dementia accumulate objects as a result of progressive neurocognitive deficit. Unlike hoarding disorder, individuals with dementia display little interest in accumulating objects or distress associated with discarding items. Furthermore, collecting behaviour in dementia may be accompanied by severe personality and behavioural changes, such as apathy, sexual indiscretions and motor stereotyped movements. Boundary with Prader-Willi syndrome Prader-Willi syndrome is associated with an increased drive to eat and a range of compulsive symptoms, including food storing. The presence of short stature, hypogonadism, failure to thrive, hypotonia and a history of feeding difficulty in the neonatal period are helpful for the differential diagnosis with hoarding disorder.
