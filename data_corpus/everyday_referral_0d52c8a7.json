Neurocognitive functioning specifically refers to neurologically based cognitive skills and abilities believed to be directly related to brain functioning, including but not limited to attention/concentration, memory, language, visual spatial/perceptual skills, processing speed and executive functioning (e.g. problem solving, judgement).
