  "text_en": "obsessive-compulsive disorder In contrast to stereotyped movement disorder, repetitive behaviours (i.e. compulsions) observed in obsessive-compulsive disorder are typically more complex, and are aimed at neutralizing unwanted intrusive thoughts (i.e. obsessions) and reducing associated negative emotions (e.g. anxiety). Boundary with body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders Body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders (e.g. trichotillomania and excoriation disorder) are characterized by recurrent and habitual behaviours directed at the integument (e.g. hair and skin). In contrast, stereotyped movements in stereotyped movement disorder rarely include hair-pulling or skin-picking behaviour; if they do, the behaviour tends to be composed of coordinated movements that are patterned and predictable, utilizing the same muscle groups in a particular sequence to produce the behaviour. In addition, stereotyped movements are more likely to present very early in life (below 2 years of age), whereas body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders typically have an onset in later childhood or early adolescence. Boundary with Tourette syndrome and other tic disorders In contrast to tic disorders including Tourette syndrome, stereotyped movements in stereotyped movement disorder tend to be composed of coordinated movements that are patterned and predictable, and can be interrupted with distraction. Stereotyped movement disorder is further differentiated from tics and Tourette syndrome because the symptoms tend to emerge at a younger age, last longer than typical tics, lack a premonitory sensory urge, and may be experienced as enjoyable. Boundary with drug-induced dystonia (tardive dyskinesia). Drug-induced dystonia is a movement disorder (classified in Chapter 8 on diseases of the nervous system) that is most frequently caused by antipsychotic medication. It is also sometimes referred to as tardive dyskinesia. Symptoms may include involuntary oral or facial movements or, less commonly, irregular trunk or limb movements. A diagnosis of stereotyped movement disorder is not appropriate in such cases. Boundary with diseases of the nervous system Involuntary movements associated with diseases of the nervous system usually follow a typical pattern with the presence of pathognomic signs and symptoms. If stereotyped movements are associated with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or another specific disease of the nervous system or neurodevelopmental disease, stereotyped movement disorder should not be diagnosed unless the movements become a separate focus of clinical attention. In such cases, both diagnoses may be assigned. Neurodevelopmental disorders | Stereotyped movement disorder",
