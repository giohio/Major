Boundary with normality (threshold) • Some depressed mood is a normal reaction to severe adverse life events and problems, and is common in the community. Dysthymic disorder is differentiated from this common experience by the severity, range and duration of symptoms. Assessment of the presence or absence of signs or symptoms should be made relative to typical functioning of the individual. Course features • Dysthymic disorder typically has a gradual onset beginning in childhood, adolescence or early adulthood. • The course of dysthymic disorder may fluctuate between dysthymia and symptoms of single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder. • Early onset of dysthymic disorder is associated with increased likelihood of co-occurring anxiety and fear-related disorders, personality disorder and substance use disorders. • In contrast to high rates of co-occurring mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders in young adults, dysthymic disorder in older adults typically occurs without co- occurrence. • Greater symptom severity, higher levels of negative affectivity, poorer global functioning and the presence of an anxiety or fear-related disorder or conduct-dissocial disorder have been associated with poorer long-term outcomes. Developmental presentations • In young children, dysthymic disorder may present as somatic complaints (e.g. headaches, stomach pains), whining, increased anxiety or fearfulness, or excessive crying. • Adolescents with dysthymic disorder may demonstrate low self-esteem, and may be more reactive to negative (or perceived negative) feedback from others. • Children and adolescents may present with pervasive irritability rather than depressed mood. However, the presence of irritability is not in and of itself indicative of dysthymic disorder, and may indicate the presence of another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder or be a normal reaction to frustration.
