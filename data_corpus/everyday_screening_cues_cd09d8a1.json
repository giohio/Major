Additional clinical features • Persistent disregard for the child’s basic needs may meet the definition for neglect: egregious acts or omissions by a caregiver that deprive a child of needed age-appropriate care and that result, or have reasonable potential to result, in physical or psychological harm. Disinhibited social engagement disorder is associated with persistent neglect rather than isolated incidents. • Disinhibited social engagement disorder may also be associated with persistent maltreatment, characterized by one or more of the following: • non-accidental acts of physical force that result, or have reasonable potential to result, in physical harm or that evoke significant fear; • sexual acts involving a child that are intended to provide sexual gratification to an adult; • non-accidental verbal or symbolic acts",
