Examples of specific personality disturbances in moderate personality disorder Note: this list of examples is not exhaustive, and it is not intended to suggest that all items will be present in any single individual. • The individual’s sense of self may become incoherent in times of crisis. • The individual has considerable difficulty maintaining positive self-esteem. Alternatively, the individual has an unrealistically positive self-view that is not modified by evidence to the contrary. • The individual exhibits poor emotion regulation in the face of setbacks, often becoming highly upset and giving up easily. Alternatively, the individual may persist unreasonably in pursuit of goals that have no chance of success. • The individual may exhibit little genuine interest in or efforts towards sustained employment. • Major limitations in the ability to understand and appreciate others’ perspectives hinder development of close and mutually satisfying relationships. • There are persistent problems in those relationships that do exist. They may be characterized by frequent, serious and volatile conflict, or be significantly unbalanced (e.g. the individual is highly dominant or highly submissive). • Under stress there are marked distortions in the individual’s situational and interpersonal appraisals. There may be mild dissociative states or psychotic-like beliefs or perceptions (e.g. paranoid ideas).
