Typically, these individuals seek weight-loss treatment after the onset of the disorder; binge eating does not typically arise as a consequence of treatment. • Binge-eating disorder occurs more often among overweight and obese individuals than those with normal BMI. • Individuals who seek treatment for binge-eating disorder are typically older in age compared to individuals who seek treatment for other feeding and eating disorders. • Binge-eating disorder, although often persistent, has a higher rate of remission than other feeding and eating disorders, with remission sometimes occurring spontaneously. • The features of binge-eating disorder may evolve over time, such that another feeding or eating disorder may better characterize the current symptoms. Developmental presentations • In children, as in adults, binge-eating disorder is associated with weight gain, increased body fat, concealing one’s eating and use of binge eating to regulate emotions. • Binge-eating disorder is more difficult to diagnose in childhood due to normative difficulty engaging in introspection in order to articulate reasons for binge-eating behaviour. Children are likely to report feeling out of control while eating rather than indicating that the amount of food consumed was excessive. • Children with binge-eating disorder may experience less frequent and briefer binges than adults because they typically cannot gain access to food without the assistance of adults. • Binge-eating disorder is common among adolescents and young adults. Culture-related features • Compared to other feeding and eating disorders, binge-eating disorder appears to be more equally distributed across countries, ethnic groups and genders. The prevalence of binge-eating disorder is at least as high in low-",
