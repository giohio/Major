Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Substance withdrawal Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours 485 Table 6.16. contd Substance Substance-specific features of withdrawal Synthetic Presenting features of synthetic cannabinoid withdrawal may include irritability, cannabinoids anger, aggression, shakiness, insomnia and disturbing dreams, restlessness, anxiety, depressed or dysphoric mood and appetite disturbance. In the early phase, synthetic cannabinoid withdrawal may be accompanied by residual features of intoxication from the drug, such as paranoid ideation and auditory and visual hallucinations. Additional features • The occurrence, severity and duration of synthetic cannabinoid withdrawal vary according to the type and potency of the synthetic cannabinoid used, as well as the amount, frequency and duration of use before cessation or reduction of use. • Synthetic cannabinoid withdrawal typically lasts for 1–3 weeks after cessation of use. Opioids Presenting features of opioid withdrawal may include depressed or dysphoric mood, craving for an opioid, anxiety, nausea or vomiting, abdominal cramps, muscle aches, yawning, perspiration, hot and cold flushes, hypersomnia (typically in the initial phase) or insomnia, diarrhoea, piloerection and pupillary dilation. Additional features • The severity and time course of opioid withdrawal is influenced by many factors that include the type of opioid taken, its half-life and duration of action, the amount, frequency and duration of opioid use before cessation or reduction of use, prior experience of opioid withdrawal, and expectations of the severity of the syndrome. • Opioid withdrawal from short-acting opioids such as injected heroin or morphine typically begins within 4–12 hours of cessation of use and lasts for 4–10 days. • Opioid withdrawal from longer-acting opioids such as codeine, oxycodone and similar pharmaceutical agents may not be evident for 2–4 days and may last for 1–2 weeks. • The withdrawal state from long-acting drugs such as methadone may persist for up to 2 months after cessation of use. • Opioid withdrawal occurs in phases. The early phase typically includes lacrimation, rhinorrhoea and yawning. This is followed by hot and cold flashes, muscle aching and abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting and diarrhoea; piloerection and pupillary dilatation may also occur. The later phase is dominated by craving for opioids. • Recurrence or worsening of pain may occur if the opioid was used to manage chronic pain. • Serious medical complications of opioid withdrawal are rare. Fluid depletion may occasionally lead to renal impairment. Death during opioid withdrawal is very uncommon. Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Substance withdrawal",
