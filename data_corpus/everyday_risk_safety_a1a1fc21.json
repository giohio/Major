In both cases, functional impairment in broad areas of life (e.g. employment, interpersonal relationships) among people with personality disorder is often persistent. • Personality disorder is relatively stable after young adulthood, but may change such that a person who had personality disorder during young adulthood no longer meets the diagnostic requirements by middle age. • Much less commonly, a person who earlier did not have a diagnosable personality disorder develops one later in life. Emergence of personality disorder in older adults may be related to the loss of social support that had previously helped to compensate for personality disturbance. • When there is a change in personality during middle adulthood or later in life, in the absence of change in the individual’s environment, the possibility that the change is due to an underlying medical condition (e.g. secondary personality change) or to an unrecognized disorder due to substance use should be considered. Developmental presentations • Personality disorder is not typically diagnosed in pre-adolescent children. Over the course of their development, children integrate knowledge and experience about themselves and other people into a coherent identity and sense of self, as well as into individual styles of interacting with others. Different children vary substantially in the rate at which this integration occurs, and there is also substantial variation in the rate of integration within individuals over time. Therefore, it is very difficult to determine whether a pre-adolescent child exhibits problems in functioning in aspects of the self, such as identity, self-worth, accuracy of self-view or self-direction, because these functions are not fully developed in children. This is also true of interpersonal functions such as the ability to understand others’ perspectives and to manage conflict in relationships. • However, prominent maladaptive traits may be observable in pre-adolescent children and may be precursors to personality disorder in adolescence and adulthood. For example, individual differences in negative affectivity and disinhibition, as well as more specific features such as lack of empathy (an aspect of dissociality) and perfectionism (an aspect of anankastia) may be observed in very young children. However, such traits are also associated with the development of other mental disorders (e.g. mood disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders) and should not be interpreted as childhood forms of personality disorder. • Features of personality disorder manifest in similar ways in adolescents and in adults. However, in evaluating adolescents, it is important to consider the developmental typicality of the relevant behaviour patterns. For example, risk-taking behaviour, self- harm and moodiness are more common during adolescence than during adulthood. Therefore, thresholds for evaluating whether such behaviour patterns are indicative of personality disorder or of elevations in trait domains such as disinhibition and negative affectivity among adolescents should be correspondingly higher. The wide variability in normal adolescent development that may affect the expression of these behaviours or characteristics should also be considered.
