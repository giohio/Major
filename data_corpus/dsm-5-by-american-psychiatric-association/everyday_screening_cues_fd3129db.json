Generalized rigidity, described as “lead pipe” in its most severe form and usually unresponsive to antiparkinsonian agents, is a cardinal feature of the disorder and may be associated with other neurological symptoms (e.g., tremor, sialorrhea, akinesia, dystonia, trismus, my- oclonus, dysarthria, dysphagia, rhabdomyolysis).
