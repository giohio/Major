  "text_en": "Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder 79 Recording Procedures ICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the bipolar mood symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is un- known, the category “unknown substance” should be used. The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the substance- induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of irritable symptoms occurring during intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.84 cocaine-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during intoxication. An additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe cocaine use disorder is also given. When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of bipolar mood symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., 292.84 methylphe- nidate-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during in- toxication; 292.84 dexamethasone-induced bipolar and related disor- der, with onset during intoxication).
