If self-derogatory ideation is present in grief, it typically involves perceived failings vis-à-vis the deceased (e.g., not visiting frequently enough, not telling the deceased how much he or she was loved). If a bereaved individual thinks about death and dying, such thoughts are generally focused on the deceased and possibly about “joining” the deceased, whereas in an MDE, such thoughts are focused on ending one’s own life because of feeling worthless, undeserving of life, or unable to cope with the pain of depression.

The symptoms of depression or the unpredictability caused by frequent alternation between periods of depression and hypoma- nia causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Coding and Recording Procedures Bipolar II disorder has one diagnostic code: 296.89 (F31.81). Its status with respect to current severity, presence of psychotic features, course, and other specifiers cannot be coded but should be indicated in writing (e.g., 296.89 [F31.81] bipolar II disorder, current episode de- pressed, moderate severity, with mixed features; 296.89 [F31.81] bi- polar II disorder, most recent episode depressed, in partial remission). Specify current or most recent episode: Hypomanic Depressed Specify if: With anxious distress (pp. 83–84) With mixed features (pp. 84–86) With rapid cycling (p. 86) With mood-congruent psychotic features (pp. 88–89) With mood-incongruent psychotic features (pp. 88–89) With catatonia (p. 89). Coding note: Use additional code 293.89 (F06.1). With peripartum onset (pp. 89–90) With seasonal pattern (pp. 90–92): Applies only to the pattern of major depressive episodes. Specify course if full criteria for a mood episode are not currently met: In partial remission (p. 92) In full remission (p. 92) Specify severity if full criteria for a mood episode are currently met: Mild (p. 92) Moderate (p. 92) Severe (p. 92)",
