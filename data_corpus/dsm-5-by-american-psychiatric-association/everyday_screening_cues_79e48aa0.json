Coding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medication]-induced sleep disorders are indicated in the ta- ble below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced sleep disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced sleep disorder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced sleep disorder”). If a moderate or severe sub- stance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced sleep dis- order, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disor- der” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disor- der. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one- time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the substance-induced sleep dis- order. A moderate or severe tobacco use disorder is required in order to code a tobacco-induced sleep disorder; it is not permissible to code a comorbid mild tobacco use disorder or no tobacco use disorder with a tobacco-induced sleep disorder.",
