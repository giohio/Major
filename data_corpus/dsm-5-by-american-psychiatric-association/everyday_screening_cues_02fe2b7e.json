For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for “other substance” with no comorbid substance use should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “un- known substance” with no comorbid substance use should be used.
