Coding note (for 780.57 [G47.37] code only): When an opioid use disorder is present, first code the opioid use disorder: 305.50 (F11.10) mild opioid use disorder or 304.00 (F11.20) moderate or se- vere opioid use disorder; then code 780.57 (G47.37) central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use. When an opioid use disorder is not present (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), code only 780.57 (G47.37) central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use. Specify current severity: Severity of central sleep apnea is graded according to the fre- quency of the breathing disturbances as well as the extent of as- sociated oxygen desaturation and sleep fragmentation that occur as a consequence of repetitive respiratory disturbances. Sleep-Related Hypoventilation A. Polysomnograpy demonstrates episodes of decreased respira- tion associated with elevated CO levels. (Note: In the absence 2 of objective measurement of CO , persistent low levels of hemo- 2 globin oxygen saturation unassociated with apneic/hypopneic events may indicate hypoventilation.) B. The disturbance is not better explained by another current sleep disorder.
