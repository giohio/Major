If the substance-induced depressive disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F16.94 phencyclidine-induced depressive disorder, with onset during intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a sig- nificant role in the development of depressive mood symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., F15.24 severe methylphenidate use disorder with methylphenidate-induced depressive disorder, with onset during withdrawal; F19.94 dexamethasone-induced depressive disorder, with onset during intoxication). Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition A. A prominent and persistent period of depressed mood or mark- edly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities that predominates in the clinical picture. B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or lab- oratory findings that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiolog- ical consequence of another medical condition. C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disor- der (e.g., adjustment disorder, with depressed mood, in which the stressor is a serious medical condition). D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
