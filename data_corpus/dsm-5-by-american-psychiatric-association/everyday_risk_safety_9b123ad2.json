Total resolution of symptoms can be obtained in most cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome; however, fatality rates of 10%–20% have been reported when the disorder is not recog- nized. Although many individuals do not experience a recurrence of neuroleptic malignant syndrome when rechallenged with antipsy- chotic medication, some do, especially when antipsychotics are rein- stituted soon after an episode. Risk and Prognostic Factors Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a potential risk in any individual after antipsychotic drug administration. It is not specific to any neu- ropsychiatric diagnosis and may occur in individuals without a di- agnosable mental disorder who receive dopamine antagonists. Clinical, systemic, and metabolic factors associated with a height- ened risk of neuroleptic malignant syndrome include agitation, exhaustion, dehydration, and iron deficiency. A prior episode asso- ciated with antipsychotics has been described in 15%–20% of index cases, suggesting underlying vulnerability in some patients; how- ever, genetic findings based on neurotransmitter receptor polymor- phisms have not been replicated consistently. Nearly all dopamine antagonists have been associated with neuro- leptic malignant syndrome, although high-potency antipsychotics pose a greater risk compared with low-potency agents and newer atypical an- tipsychotics. Partial or milder forms may be associated with newer anti- psychotics, but neuroleptic malignant syndrome varies in severity even with older drugs. Dopamine antagonists used in medical settings (e.g., metoclopramide, prochlorperazine) have also been implicated.
