Specify if: In partial remission: Symptoms of the immediately previous major depressive episode are present, but full criteria are not met, or there is a period lasting less than 2 months without any significant symptoms of a major depressive episode following the end of such an episode. In full remission: During the past 2 months, no significant signs or symptoms of the disturbance were present. Specify current severity: Severity is based on the number of criterion symptoms, the severity of those symptoms, and the degree of functional disability. Mild: Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis are present, the intensity of the symptoms is dis- tressing but manageable, and the symptoms result in minor im- pairment in social or occupational functioning. Moderate: The number of symptoms, intensity of symptoms, and/or functional impairment are between those specified for “mild” and “severe.” Severe: The number of symptoms is substantially in excess of that required to make the diagnosis, the intensity of the symp- toms is seriously distressing and unmanageable, and the symp- toms markedly interfere with social and occupational functioning.",
