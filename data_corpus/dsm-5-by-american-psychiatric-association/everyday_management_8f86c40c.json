If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced neurocognitive disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced neurocogni- tive disorder (e.g., “mild inhalant use disorder with inhalant-induced major neurocognitive disorder”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced neurocognitive disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should re- cord “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder, then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the sub- stance-induced neurocognitive disorder.
