The other specified anxiety disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to commu- nicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the crite- ria for any specific anxiety disorder. This is done by recording “other specified anxiety disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “gener- alized anxiety not occurring more days than not”). Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation include the following: 1. Limited-symptom attacks 2. Generalized anxiety not occurring more days than not 3. Khyâl cap (wind attacks): See “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress” in the Appendix to DSM-5. 4. Ataque de nervios (attack of nerves): See “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress” in the Appendix to DSM-5. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder 300.00 (F41.9) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character- istic of an anxiety disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of func- tioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the dis- orders in the anxiety disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified anxiety disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific anxiety disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insuffi- cient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emer- gency room settings).",
