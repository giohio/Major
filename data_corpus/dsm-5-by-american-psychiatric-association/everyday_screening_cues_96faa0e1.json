The other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder cate- gory is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communi- cate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder. This is done by recording “other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder” followed by the specific rea- son (e.g., “persistent auditory hallucinations”). Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation include the following: 1. Persistent auditory hallucinations occurring in the absence of any other features. 2. Delusions with significant overlapping mood episodes: This includes persistent delusions with periods of overlapping mood episodes that are present for a substantial portion of the delu- sional disturbance (such that the criterion stipulating only brief mood disturbance in delusional disorder is not met).",
