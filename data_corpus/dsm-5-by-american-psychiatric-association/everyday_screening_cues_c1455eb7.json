This is done by recording “other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “persistent complex bereavement disorder”). Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation include the following: 1. Adjustment-like disorders with delayed onset of symptoms that occur more than 3 months after the stressor. 2. Adjustment-like disorders with prolonged duration of more than 6 months without prolonged duration of stressor. 3. Ataque de nervios: See “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Dis- tress” in the Appendix to DSM-5. 4. Other cultural syndromes: See “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress” in the Appendix to DSM-5. 5. Persistent complex bereavement disorder: This disorder is characterized by severe and persistent grief and mourning reac- tions (see the chapter “Conditions for Further Study” in Section III of DSM-5).
