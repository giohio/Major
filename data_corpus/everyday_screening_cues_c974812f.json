Instead, the appropriate mental disorder can be diagnosed (e.g. an anxiety or fear- related disorder, adjustment disorder, hypochondriasis). Boundary with delirium due to disease classified elsewhere Anxiety symptoms can occur in the context of delirium due to disease classified elsewhere. Delirium is characterized by disturbed attention (i.e. reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain and shift attention) and awareness (i.e. reduced orientation to the environment) that develops over a short period of time and tends to fluctuate during the course of a day, accompanied by other cognitive impairment such as memory deficit, disorientation or impairment in language, visuospatial ability or perception. In contrast, panic attacks or other anxiety symptoms in secondary anxiety syndrome occur in the absence of disturbed attention or severe cognitive impairment. If the anxiety symptoms are judged to be better explained by delirium due to disease classified elsewhere, an additional diagnosis of secondary anxiety syndrome is not warranted. Boundary with dementia Anxiety symptoms can occur in the context of dementia, which is characterized by a decline from a previous level of cognitive functioning with impairment in two or more cognitive domains (e.g. memory, executive functions, attention, language, social cognition and judgement, psychomotor speed, visuoperceptual or visuospatial abilities). In contrast, secondary anxiety syndrome is not accompanied by marked cognitive impairment. The presence of anxiety symptoms in the context of dementia can be recorded using the anxiety symptoms in dementia specifier. If the anxiety symptoms are judged to be due to the same medical condition as is causing the dementia, an additional diagnosis of secondary anxiety syndrome is not warranted. Boundary with anxiety symptoms caused by substances or medications, including withdrawal effects When establishing a diagnosis of secondary anxiety syndrome, it is important to rule out the possibility that a medication or substance is causing the anxiety symptoms instead of – or in addition to – an underlying medical condition. This involves first considering whether any of the medications being used to treat the medical condition are known to cause anxiety symptoms at the dose and duration at which it has been administered. Second, a temporal relationship between the medication use and the onset of the anxiety symptoms should be established (i.e. the anxiety symptoms began after administration of the medication and/or remitted once the medication was discontinued). The same reasoning applies to individuals with a medical condition and anxiety symptoms who are also using a psychoactive substance known to cause anxiety, in the context of either intoxication or withdrawal (e.g. panic attacks during anxiolytic or opioid withdrawal, physiological symptoms of excessive autonomic arousal in stimulant intoxication). In such cases, if the intensity or duration of the anxiety symptoms is substantially in excess of anxiety symptoms that are characteristic of the substance-specific intoxication or withdrawal syndrome, then substance-induced anxiety disorder is the appropriate diagnosis, applying the appropriate category corresponding to the substance involved.
