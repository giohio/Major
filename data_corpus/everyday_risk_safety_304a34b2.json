In this case, the diagnosis may be changed to binge-eating disorder if all diagnostic requirements are met. • Stressful life events or a history of anorexia nervosa increase the likelihood of the onset of bulimia nervosa. A restricting pattern in anorexia nervosa may evolve over time into a pattern of binging and purging in bulimia nervosa. In such cases, the diagnosis may be changed to bulimia nervosa after 1 year during which body weight has not been sufficiently low to meet the diagnostic requirements of anorexia nervosa. Developmental presentations • Onset of bulimia nervosa typically occurs during or shortly after puberty. Young children do not commonly engage in binge eating due to a lack of access and control of food availability. Culture-related features • The prevalence of bulimia nervosa is higher in cultures characterized by an idealized thin body ideal. In addition, the prevalence of bulimia nervosa is increasing in countries that are industrializing and transitioning to more global and urbanized societies. • The distribution of bulimia nervosa across cultural groups within a society can change over time. For example, in the United States, the incidence of the disorder appears to be decreasing among Euro-American females and increasing among ethnic minority groups – particularly Latin Americans and African Americans. • Purging methods may be locally specific, such as the use of herbal purgatives in Asia and the Pacific region (e.g. seaweed and herbal teas in Japan; indigenous tea in Fiji), and justified with medicinal or other rationales that may obscure their pathological significance. Sex- and/or gender-related features • Bulimia nervosa is more prevalent among females. • Males are less likely than females to engage in purging behaviours, and have a greater tendency to use excessive exercise or steroids as compensatory behaviours in response to binges. Males are also less likely to seek treatment. Feeding and eating disorders | Bulimia nervosa",
