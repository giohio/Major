Others may pick at their skin in response to tactile sensitivity (i.e. skin irregularities) or bothersome skin sensations. In such cases, skin picking often results in an alleviation of tension, relief or a sense of gratification. • Excoriation disorder is generally considered a chronic condition. Some individuals may experience a waxing and waning of symptoms over weeks, months or years at a time. Developmental presentations • Excoriation disorder most often has its onset during adolescence, typically corresponding to puberty. However, the emergence of symptoms can occur across the lifespan. • Childhood-onset excoriation disorder is more prevalent among females. • Automatic skin picking, which tends to occur unintentionally, outside awareness, appears more frequently among individuals with childhood-onset excoriation disorder. Skin picking then appears to shift in adolescence and adulthood, as picking becomes focused. This picking appears to be generally intentional, connected to intense urges to pick, and often results in a sense of relief.
