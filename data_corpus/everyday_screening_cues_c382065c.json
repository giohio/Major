They may be accompanied by psychomotor disturbances and negative symptoms such as blunted or flat affect. These symptoms do not occur primarily as a result of substance use (e.g. hallucinogen intoxication) or another medical condition not classified under mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. Huntington disease). The disorders in this grouping are referred to as “primary psychotic disorders” because psychotic symptoms are their defining feature. Psychotic symptoms may also occur in the context of other mental disorders (e.g. in mood disorders or dementia), but in these cases the symptoms occur alongside other characteristic features of those disorders. Whereas experiences of reality loss/distortion occur on a continuum and can be found throughout the population, disorders in this group represent patterns of symptoms and behaviours that occur with sufficient frequency and intensity to deviate from expected cultural or subcultural expectations. Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders include the following: 6A20 Schizophrenia 6A21 Schizoaffective disorder 6A22 Schizotypal disorder 6A23 Acute and transient psychotic disorder 6A24 Delusional disorder 6A2Y Other specified primary psychotic disorder 6A2Z Schizophrenia or other primary psychotic disorder, unspecified. In the context of schizotypal disorder, symptoms may be substantially attenuated such that they may be characterized as eccentric or peculiar rather than overtly psychotic. The categories in the grouping of schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders should not be used to classify the expression of ideas, beliefs or behaviours that are culturally sanctioned. Many religious or cultural practices worldwide incorporate experiences qualitatively similar in nature to the symptoms described for this grouping of disorders, and these should not be considered to be pathological.
