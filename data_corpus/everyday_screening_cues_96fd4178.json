A diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder is still appropriate in such cases. Specifiers for characterizing features within the autism spectrum These specifiers enable the identification of co-occurring limitations in intellectual and functional language abilities, which are important factors in the appropriate individualization of support, selection of interventions and treatment planning for individuals with autism spectrum disorder. A specifier is also provided for loss of previously acquired skills, which is a feature of the developmental history of a small proportion of individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Co-occurring disorder of intellectual development Individuals with autism spectrum disorder may exhibit limitations in intellectual abilities. If present, a separate diagnosis of disorder of intellectual development should be assigned, using the appropriate category to designate severity (i.e. mild, moderate, severe, profound, provisional). Because social deficits are a core feature of autism spectrum disorder, the assessment of adaptive behaviour as a part of the diagnosis of a co-occurring disorder of intellectual development should place greater emphasis on the intellectual, conceptual and practical domains of adaptive functioning than on social skills. If no co-occurring diagnosis of disorder of intellectual development is present, the following specifier for the autism spectrum disorder diagnosis should be applied: • without disorder of intellectual development. If there is a co-occurring diagnosis of disorder of intellectual development, the following specifier for the autism spectrum disorder diagnosis should be applied, in addition to the appropriate diagnostic code for the co-occurring disorder of intellectual development: • with disorder of intellectual development. Degree of functional language impairment The degree of impairment in functional language (spoken or signed) should be designated with a second specifier. Functional language refers to the capacity of the individual to use language for instrumental purposes (e.g. to express personal needs and desires). This specifier is intended to reflect primarily the verbal and nonverbal expressive language deficits",
