There must also be a clear causal relationship between the harm to health and the episodic or continuous use of a substance. • The likelihood of harm to self or others due behaviour related to intoxication varies substantially by substance (see Table 6.15, p. 475). For example, such behaviour is unlikely to arise from caffeine or nicotine intoxication. • A diagnosis of harmful pattern of use of unknown or unspecified psychoactive substances can be assigned if the substance consumed is initially unknown.
