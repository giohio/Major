Personality difficulty is characterized by longstanding difficulties (e.g. at least 2 years) in the individual’s way of experiencing and thinking about the self, others and the world. In contrast to personality disorder, these difficulties are manifested in cognitive and emotional experience and expression only intermittently (e.g. during times of stress) or at low intensity. The difficulties are associated with some problems in functioning, but these are insufficiently severe to cause notable disruption in social, occupational and interpersonal relationships, or may be limited to specific relationships or situations.
