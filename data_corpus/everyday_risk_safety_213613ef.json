Most dementias are progressive (e.g. dementia due to Alzheimer disease, dementia due to Lewy body disease, frontotemporal dementia), whereas other forms are reversible (e.g. dementia related to nutritional or metabolic abnormalities), stable (e.g. some cases of dementia due to cerebrovascular disease) or rapidly progressing (e.g. dementia due to prion disease). Boundary with normality (threshold) for dementia • Normal ageing is typically associated with some degree of cognitive change. Dementia is differentiated from normal ageing by the severity or magnitude of neurocognitive impairment relative to expectations for age, and by functional impairment in everyday skills and tasks. Deviation from normal ageing can be determined by standardized assessment using appropriately normed measures. When cognitive difficulties consistent with normal ageing are present and clinically relevant, the symptom code MB21.0 Age-associated cognitive decline may be used.
