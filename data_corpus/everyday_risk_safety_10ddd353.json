In the absence of such corroborating information, a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in older adolescents and adults should be made with caution. • In a subset of individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, especially in children, an exclusively inattentive presentation may occur. There is no hyperactivity, and the presentation is characterized by daydreaming, mind-wandering and a lack of focus. These children are sometimes referred to as exhibiting a “restrictive inattentive pattern of symptoms” or “sluggish cognitive tempo”. • In a subset of individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, combined presentation, severe inattentiveness and hyperactivity-impulsivity are both consistently present in most of the situations that an individual encounters, and are also evidenced by the clinician’s own observations. This pattern is often referred to as “hyperkinetic disorder”, and is considered a more severe form of the disorder. • Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms often significantly limit academic achievement. Adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder often find it difficult to hold down a demanding job, and may be disproportionately underemployed or unemployed. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder can also strain interpersonal relationships across the lifespan, including those with family members, peers and romantic partners. Individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder often have greater difficulty regulating their behaviour in the context of groups than in one-on-one situations. • Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder often co-occurs with other neurodevelopmental disorders, including developmental speech and language disorders and primary tics and tic disorders, which are classified in Chapter 8 on diseases of the nervous system but cross-listed under neurodevelopment disorders. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is associated with an increased risk of obsessive-compulsive disorder and gaming disorder, and with elevated rates of epilepsy. Emotional dysregulation, low frustration tolerance and subtle clumsiness and other minor (“soft”) neurological abnormalities in sensory and motor performance in the absence of any identifiable brain pathology are also common in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
