Additional clinical features • In rumination-regurgitation disorder, the regurgitation behaviour is intentional; for example, individuals may contract the tongue or abdominal muscles or cough in order to induce regurgitation. Individuals with rumination-regurgitation disorder are able to regurgitate food with relative ease, and may derive some reduction of anxiety or pleasure from the behaviour. • Individuals with rumination-regurgitation disorder often experience shame and embarrassment about the behaviour, and try to keep the behaviour a secret because they recognize it as socially unacceptable. • Individuals with rumination-regurgitation disorder are often reluctant to seek treatment. The disorder may persist for a very long duration if left untreated. Course features • Rumination-regurgitation disorder is slightly more prevalent among individuals with disorders of intellectual development and autism spectrum disorder, whereby it may serve a self-soothing or self-stimulating function. • Rumination-regurgitation disorder may be chronic or continuous, or it may be episodic. In episodic cases, the behaviour may be associated with stress or anxiety. • Adolescents and adults may be less likely to re-chew the regurgitated food, and older adults may choose to swallow or spit out the material depending on the social situation. Developmental presentations • Onset of rumination-regurgitation disorder may occur across early and later childhood, adolescence and adulthood. • Rumination-regurgitation disorder can create a substantial risk of choking in very young children due to their inability to control their swallowing.
