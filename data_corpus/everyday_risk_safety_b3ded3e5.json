Where available, chromosome testing can assist in identifying other health risks associated with specific underlying chromosomal abnormalities. If a specific chromosomal or other developmental anomaly is identified, this should be diagnosed in addition to the developmental language disorder. • Regression of language skills once acquired is not a feature of developmental language disorder. Reported loss of early first words in the second year of life associated with a decline in social and communication behaviours – and, more rarely, loss of language skills after 3 years of age – may be a presentation of autism spectrum disorder. Language abilities may also be lost due to diseases of the nervous system including acquired brain injury from stroke, trauma or encephalopathy with or without overt epilepsy. Concomitant loss of physical skills with language abilities may be indicative of a neurodegenerative condition. When an underlying neurological cause has been identified, the condition should not be diagnosed as developmental language disorder but rather as secondary speech or language syndrome, which should be assigned in addition to the appropriate diagnosis for the underlying condition. Boundary with normality (threshold) • Children vary widely in the age at which they first acquire spoken language and in the pace at which language skills become firmly established. The majority of preschool-aged children who acquire speech later than expected go on to develop normal language abilities. Very early delays in language acquisition are therefore not indicative of developmental language disorder. However, the absence of single words (or word approximations) by 2 years of age, the failure to generate simple two-word phrases by 3 years of age, and language impairments that are persistent over time are more likely to indicate developmental language disorder, especially in the context of a known family history of language or literacy learning problems. By 4 years of age, individual differences in language ability are more stable. Neurodevelopmental disorders | Developmental speech and language disorders",
