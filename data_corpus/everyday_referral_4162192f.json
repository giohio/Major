Additional categories of disorders induced by psychoactive substances are included in other parts of this chapter on mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders. These categories relate to substance-induced catatonia, substance-induced amnestic disorder and substance-induced dementia. They are cross-listed in the section below on substance-induced mental disorders for reference. Note that not all possible combinations of disorder and substance class are included in the classification. For example, there is no category for substance withdrawal due to dissociative drugs, including ketamine and PCP, and no category for nicotine-induced psychotic disorder. Allowable categories by substance class for episode of harmful psychoactive substance use, harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use, substance dependence, substance intoxication and substance withdrawal are shown in Table 6.13 (p. 450). Allowable categories by substance class for substance-induced mental disorders (substance-induced delirium, substance-induced psychotic disorder, substance-induced mood disorder, substance-induced anxiety disorder, substance-induced obsessive-compulsive or related disorder and substance-induced impulse control disorder) are shown in Table 6.14 (p. 454). CDDR are provided below for each type of disorder, together with a list of applicable substance classes. Information specific to particular substance classes is also provided when applicable. The first three diagnoses listed above (episode of harmful psychoactive substance use, harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use and substance dependence) describe the use pattern of the substance. One of these three diagnoses – or disorder due to substance use, unspecified, for cases in which the use pattern in unknown at the time of evaluation – is considered to be the primary diagnosis.
