In children and adolescents depressed mood can manifest as pervasive irritability. • The depressed mood is accompanied by additional symptoms typically seen in a depressive episode, though these may be milder in form. Examples include: • markedly diminished interest or pleasure in activities • reduced concentration and attention, or indecisiveness • low self-worth, or excessive or inappropriate guilt • hopelessness about the future • disturbed sleep or increased sleep • diminished or increased appetite • low energy or fatigue. • During the first 2 years of the disorder, there has never been a 2-week period during which the number and duration of symptoms were sufficient to meet the diagnostic requirements for a depressive episode. • While brief symptom-free intervals during the period of persistent depressed mood are consistent with the diagnosis, there have never been any prolonged symptom-free periods (e.g. lasting 2 months or more) since the onset of the disorder. • There is no history of manic, mixed or hypomanic episodes, which would indicate the presence of a bipolar or related disorder. • The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. hypothyroidism), and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (e.g. benzodiazepines), including withdrawal effects (e.g. from stimulants). • The symptoms result in significant distress about experiencing persistent depressive symptoms or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort. Additional clinical features • In children, it may be appropriate to assign the diagnosis of dysthymic disorder after a briefer period of initial symptoms (e.g. 1 year). • Suicide risk is significantly higher among individuals diagnosed with dysthymic disorder than among the general population.
