In such cases, if there is no history of hypomanic episodes, single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder may be diagnosed along with cyclothymic disorder. Boundary with bipolar type I disorder If the number and severity of symptoms reaches the diagnostic threshold for a manic episode or a mixed episode in the context of an ongoing cyclothymic disorder, the diagnosis should be changed to bipolar type I disorder. Boundary with bipolar type II disorder If the number and severity of symptoms reaches the diagnostic threshold for single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder in the context of an ongoing cyclothymic disorder, and the individual has a history of hypomanic episodes but no history of manic or mixed episodes, the diagnosis should be changed to bipolar type II disorder. Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Although hypomanic symptoms overlap with symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder – such as distractibility, hyperactivity and impulsivity – hypomanic episodes are differentiated from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder by their episodic nature and the accompanying elevated, euphoric or irritable mood. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and cyclothymic disorder can co-occur; when this occurs, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms tend to worsen during hypomanic episodes. Boundary with oppositional defiant disorder It is common, particularly among children and adolescents, for patterns of noncompliance and symptoms of irritability/anger to arise as part of a mood disorder. For example, noncompliance may be a result of depressive symptoms (e.g. diminished interest or pleasure in activities, difficulty concentrating, hopelessness, psychomotor retardation, reduced energy). Individuals may be less likely to follow rules and comply with directions when experiencing hypomanic symptoms. In contrast, individuals with oppositional defiant disorder do not exhibit the episodicity characteristic of cyclothymic disorder. However, oppositional defiant disorder often co-occurs with mood Mood disorders | Cyclothymic disorder",
