However, obsessive-compulsive disorder is not characterized by discontinuities in the sense of self and agency, or the presence of two or more distinct personality states. Boundary with personality disorder Personality disorder, particularly with borderline pattern, is characterized by persistent disturbances in sense of identity and self-direction, and often by problems with affect regulation.

These intrusions may be cognitive (intruding thoughts), affective (intruding affects such as fear, anger or shame), perceptual (e.g. intruding voices, fleeting visual perceptions, sensations such as being touched), motor (e.g. involuntary movements of an arm) or behavioural (e.g. an action that lacks a sense of agency or ownership). These experiences are experienced as interfering with the functioning of the dominant personality state and are typically aversive. • The non-dominant personality states do not recurrently take executive control of the individual’s consciousness and functioning to the extent that they perform in specific aspects of daily life (e.g. parenting, work).
