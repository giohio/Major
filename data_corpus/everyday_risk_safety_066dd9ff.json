Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Substance intoxication Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours 475 Table 6.15. Common substance-specific features of substance intoxication Substance Common substance-specific features Alcohol Presenting features of alcohol intoxication may include impaired attention, inappropriate or aggressive behaviour, lability of mood and emotions, impaired judgement, poor coordination, unsteady gait, and slurred speech. At more severe levels of intoxication, stupor or coma may occur. Additional features • Alcohol intoxication may be associated with impaired social interaction. • Impaired coordination and judgement due to alcohol intoxication, even at low doses, may be sufficiently severe to affect the faculties necessary to operate motorized vehicles safely: alcohol intoxication is an important risk factor for road accidents. • The disinhibiting effects of alcohol are associated with an increased risk of attempted and completed suicides. • Higher blood levels of alcohol (e.g. >150 mg/dL) are associated with stupor and coma. Blood levels of alcohol above 250 mg/dL can cause respiratory depression, cardiac arrhythmias and death. • Stupor and coma are more likely to occur in individuals with low tolerance or comorbid medical conditions. • The more severe the intoxication, the greater the likelihood of subsequent amnesia for events that took place during the period of intoxication (“blackouts”). • Some symptoms of intoxication with other substances (e.g. sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics; opioids) may be similar to those of alcohol intoxication. Evidence of alcohol use (e.g. the smell of alcohol on the breath) does not rule out concomitant intoxication with other substances. Cannabis or synthetic Presenting features of cannabis intoxication or synthetic cannabinoid intoxication cannabinoids may include inappropriate euphoria, impaired attention, impaired judgement, perceptual alterations (such as the sensation of floating, altered perception of time), changes in sociability, increased appetite, anxiety, intensification of ordinary experiences, impaired short-term memory and sluggishness. Physical signs include conjunctival injection (red or bloodshot eyes), dry mouth and tachycardia. Additional features • The principal psychoactive cannabinoid is cannabis is THC. Disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behaviour or coordination typical of cannabis intoxication are primarily attributable to levels of THC, although various other cannabinoids are also present in cannabis preparations (e.g. dried leaves and buds, hashish, cannabis oil). • Synthetic cannabinoid intoxication may cause delirium or acute psychosis. • Regular intoxication with high potency cannabis or synthetic cannabinoids may be associated with increased long-term risk of psychosis. Note: medicinal cannabinoids such as cannabidiol and cannabinol – for example, those used as antispasmodics, anxiolytics or analgesics – typically have no or minimal intoxicating effects. However, standard laboratory testing for cannabinoids may not be able to differentiate among these different types of cannabinoids.
