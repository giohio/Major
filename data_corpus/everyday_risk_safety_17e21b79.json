Culture-related features • There is substantial variation in the prevalence of oppositional defiant disorder across cultures. These differences may be related to cultural norms regarding uncooperative or defiant behaviour in children. For example, cultures that value obedience highly may have a lower threshold for considering a child’s behaviour to be noncompliant, defiant or disobedient. The behaviours relevant to assigning a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder should be evaluated in relation to social, cultural and subgroup norms. • Variation in the prevalence of oppositional defiant disorder and conduct-dissocial disorder across cultural groups may be related to differences in family structure and behaviour. Lower prevalence may be associated with stricter disciplinary practices at home, strong emphasis on educational or occupational attainment, and cultural values that disapprove of an antisocial lifestyle. Sex- and/or gender-related features • Prevalence of oppositional defiant disorder is higher among school-aged boys than school- aged girls, but does not appear to differ by gender at other points across the lifespan. Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis) Boundary with conduct-dissocial disorder The behaviour problems associated with oppositional defiant disorder are largely characterized by interpersonal conflict with authority figures and difficulty getting along with others. In contrast, conduct-dissocial disorder is characterized by a repetitive and persistent pattern of more severe and dissocial behaviour, in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate social or cultural norms, rules or laws are violated (e.g. aggression towards people or animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft, serious violations of rules). However, individuals with conduct- dissocial disorder often demonstrate a range or history of behaviour problems that may include the interpersonal difficulties characteristic of oppositional defiant disorder. Both diagnoses may be assigned if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met.
