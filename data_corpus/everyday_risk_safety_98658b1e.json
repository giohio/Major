Such transient experiences should not be considered as symptomatic of dissociative neurological symptom disorder. • Experiences resembling dissociative neurological symptom disorder can occur as a part of culturally sanctioned rituals, and in some cases can persist for several months (e.g. following a death). If such presentations are not associated with impairment in functioning, a diagnosis of dissociative neurological symptom disorder should not be assigned. Depending on the nature of the circumstances preceding the onset of symptoms, and their duration, acute stress reaction may be considered. Course features • Onset of dissociative neurological symptom disorder typically occurs between puberty and early adulthood; although onset in early childhood (as young as the age of 3 years) has been observed, it is extremely rare. Onset after the age of 35 years is uncommon. • The onset of dissociative neurological symptom disorder is usually acute, and the disorder may follow either a transient or a persistent course. Symptoms are typically of brief duration (e.g. remission within 2 weeks) but commonly recur. • Onset is often associated with a traumatic or adverse life event. Prior physical injury and a history of childhood abuse or neglect are risk factors for dissociative neurological symptom disorder. In addition, a prior disease of the nervous system is a risk factor for the disorder; for example, individuals with a history of epilepsy are more likely to exhibit non-epileptic seizures. Patients may also present with symptoms that closely resemble the symptoms of physical illnesses experienced by their friends or family members. • Non-epileptic seizures are more likely to have their onset earlier in the lifespan than motor symptoms. • Positive prognostic factors include younger age, acute onset, onset associated with a clearly identifiable stressor, early diagnosis, monosymptomatic presentation, short duration of symptoms, and short interval between symptom onset and initiation of treatment. Patients with good premorbid adjustment and above-average intelligence, and those who accept the psychological nature of the disorder also have a better prognosis. Negative prognostic factors include non-transient symptoms, polysymptomatic presentation, the presence of comorbid medical conditions and co-occurring mental disorders (e.g. mood disorders or anxiety and fear-related disorders). Patients with maladaptive personality traits, history of sexual abuse or poor physical functioning prior to diagnosis also have a poorer prognosis. • Individuals with symptoms of paralysis, aphonia, blindness or deafness tend",
