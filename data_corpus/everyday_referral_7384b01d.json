Although these also have some features in common with disorders in other groupings (e.g. anxiety and fear-related disorders), those included in the grouping of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders have commonalities on key diagnostic validators and frequently co-occur, which may be related in part to shared genetic factors. Cognitive phenomena such as obsessions, intrusive thoughts and preoccupations are central to a subset of these conditions (obsessive-compulsive disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, hypochondriasis and olfactory reference disorder), and are accompanied by related repetitive behaviours. Hoarding disorder is not associated with intrusive unwanted thoughts but rather characterized by a compulsive need to accumulate possessions and by distress related to discarding them. Also included in the grouping are body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders, which are primarily characterized by recurrent and habitual actions directed at the integument (e.g. hair pulling, skin picking) and lack a prominent cognitive aspect.
