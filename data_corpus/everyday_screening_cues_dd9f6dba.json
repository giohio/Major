  "text_en": "Additional clinical features • Some individuals with generalized anxiety disorder may only report general apprehensiveness accompanied by chronic somatic symptoms without being able to articulate specific worry content. • Behavioural changes such as avoidance, frequent need for reassurance (especially in children) and procrastination may be seen. These behaviours typically represent an effort to reduce apprehension or prevent untoward events from occurring. Boundary with normality (threshold) • Anxiety and worry are normal emotional/cognitive states that commonly occur when people are under stress. At optimal levels, anxiety and worry may help to direct problem- solving efforts, focus attention adaptively and increase alertness. Normal anxiety and worry are usually sufficiently self-regulated that they do not interfere with functioning or cause marked distress. In generalized anxiety disorder, the anxiety or worry is excessive, persistent and intense, and may have a significant negative impact on functioning. Individuals under extremely stressful circumstances (e.g. living in a war zone) may experience intense and impairing anxiety and worry that is appropriate to their environmental circumstances. These experiences should not be regarded as symptomatic of generalized anxiety disorder if they occur only under such circumstances. Course features • Onset of generalized anxiety disorder may occur at any age. However, the typical age of onset is during the early to mid-30s. • Earlier onset of symptoms is associated with greater impairment of functioning and presence of co-occurring mental disorders. • Severity of generalized anxiety disorder symptoms often fluctuates between threshold and subthreshold forms of the disorder, and full remission of symptoms is uncommon. • Although the clinical features of generalized anxiety disorder generally remain consistent across the lifespan, the content of the individual’s worry may vary over time, and there are differences in worry content among different age groups. Children and adolescents tend to worry about the quality of academic and sports-related performance, whereas adults tend to worry more about their own well-being or that of their loved ones.
