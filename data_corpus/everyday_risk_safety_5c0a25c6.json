If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort. Additional clinical features • Specific phobia encompasses fears of a broad and heterogeneous group of phobic stimuli. The most common are for particular animals (animal phobia), heights (acrophobia), enclosed spaces (claustrophobia), sight of blood or injury (blood-injury phobia), flying, driving, storms, darkness and medical/dental procedures. Individuals’ reactions to phobic stimuli can range from feelings of disgust and revulsion (often occurring in animal phobias or blood-injury phobias), to anticipation of danger or harm (common across most types of specific phobia) and physical symptoms such as fainting (most common in response to blood or injury). • The majority of individuals diagnosed with specific phobia report fear of multiple objects or situations. A single diagnosis of specific phobia is assigned regardless of the number of feared objects or situations. Unlike most phobic stimuli, which upon presentation or anticipation typically result in significant physiological arousal, individuals who fear the sight of blood, invasive medical procedures or injury may experience a vasovagal response that can result in a fainting spell. • Some individuals with specific phobia may report a history of having observed another person (e.g. a caregiver) react with fear or anxiety when confronted by an object or situation, resulting in vicarious learning of a fear response to the object or situation. Others may have had a direct negative experience with an object or situation (e.g. having been bitten by a dog).",
