  "text_en": "for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders • Co-occurrence with other anxiety and fear-related disorders (particularly social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder and specific phobias) is very common among individuals with selective mutism. • Selective mutism is associated with severe impairment in academic and social functioning that can manifest as inability to complete expected schoolwork, not getting needed assistance or support (because the child does not ask for it), inability to initiate or reciprocate social interactions with peers, or becoming the target of bullying. • Social anxiety, withdrawal and avoidance in selective mutism may be related to temperamental factors such as behavioural inhibition and negative affectivity. Boundary with normality (threshold) • Transient reluctance to speak at the time of first starting school is a common occurrence. Selective mutism should only be diagnosed if symptoms persist beyond the first month of schooling. Immigrant children who are unfamiliar with or uncomfortable in the official language of their new host country may, for a discrete period of time, refuse to speak to strangers in their new environment. This may also occur with children from linguistic minorities. Selective mutism should not be diagnosed in such cases. Course features • Although the onset of selective mutism typically occurs during early childhood (i.e. prior to the age of 5 years), significant impairment of functioning may not manifest until entry into school, when children experience increased demands to speak publicly (e.g. reading aloud) and engage socially. • A majority of children with selective mutism will present with symptoms of another anxiety or fear-related disorder – particularly social anxiety disorder. • Children with selective mutism may also display signs of oppositionality – particularly in situations requiring speech. A co-occurring diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder should not be assigned if refusal to speak can be entirely accounted for by features of selective mutism. • The course of selective mutism varies among individuals. Although the average duration of the disorder is 8 years, after which symptoms begin to dissipate or remit completely, some individuals may experience a persistence of symptoms or a manifestation of another disorder – primarily social anxiety disorder. • Even after the core symptoms of selective mutism resolve, individuals often continue to experience difficulties related to social communication and anxiety. • A poorer prognosis is associated with a family history of selective mutism.
