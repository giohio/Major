Co-occurrence therefore complicates assessment and requires clinical judgement in attributing limitations in activities that require coordinated motor skills to a specific diagnosis. Boundary with normality (threshold) • There is considerable variation in the age of acquisition of many motor skills and a lack of stability of measurement in early childhood. Onset of developmental motor coordination disorder typically occurs during the early developmental period, but differentiation from typical development before the age of 4 years is difficult due to the variability in motor development and skill acquisition throughout early childhood. Therefore, the diagnosis of developmental motor coordination disorder is usually not made before the age of 5 years. • Performance of motor skills should ideally be assessed using appropriately normed, individually administered, culturally appropriate standardized tests of gross and fine motor coordination, and should include evaluation of the impact of symptoms at home and at school (or, in adults, in the workplace). Key features for assessment are persistence of motor skill impairment over time, severity of impairment and pervasiveness of impact on functioning. • Developmental motor coordination disorder often co-occurs with other neurodevelopmental disorders. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is most common (an estimated 50% of cases). Developmental speech and language disorder, developmental learning disorder (most often with impairments in reading and written expression) and autism spectrum disorder also commonly co-occur with developmental motor coordination disorder. Course features • Though there may be improvement in symptoms over time, with some children experiencing a complete remission of symptoms, the course of developmental motor coordination disorder is typically chronic, persisting into adolescence and adulthood in up to 50–70% of cases. The persistence of developmental motor coordination disorder into adulthood often affects social and psychological functioning as well as physical health. • The presence of other co-occurring neurodevelopmental disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, may further complicate the course of developmental motor coordination disorder. Individuals with co-occurring disorders typically experience more impairment than individuals with a single diagnosis. Neurodevelopmental disorders | Developmental motor coordination disorder",
