Boundary with paraphilic disorder involving solitary behaviour or consenting individual Some individuals have a paraphilic focus of intense sexual arousal involving the fantasy of having a serious disability, which may be associated with transient periods of wanting to acquire the disability that is the source of arousal. If the desire to acquire a disability occurs solely in connection with sexual arousal, body integrity dysphoria should not be diagnosed.
