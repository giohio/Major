Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Obsessive-compulsive disorder 304 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders Culture-related features • Similar types of obsessive-compulsivity disorder symptoms (e.g. concerns with contamination) are present cross-culturally, but cultural variation exists in the salience and prevalence of certain themes of content of obsessions and compulsions. For example, aggressive obsessions have been found to predominate in Brazil, and religious/scrupulosity concerns in Middle Eastern settings. In addition, scrupulosity obsessions may be more distressing among individuals of certain faith groups that emphasize ritual exactitude or the sinful nature of certain kinds of thoughts. The influence of culture may lead to the adoption of specific themes, such as obsessions about kashrut (dietary restrictions) observances among Jews, or about being in a state of uncleanliness (napak) among Muslims. Distinguishing religious compulsions from zealous but normative religious practice may require the help of religious experts aware of local norms. • Etiological attributions may vary across social groups, including biological, psychological, social and supernatural or spiritual explanations. These attributions may also shape the specific obsessions, such as concerns about being deserving of punishment as the result of a transgression or the object of sorcery, witchcraft or the evil eye. In some cultural groups, compulsions may be reinforced by the belief that such acts ward off evil spirits or have another spiritual function. • Help-seeking behaviour and clinical disclosure are less likely when the obsessions or compulsions are considered by the individual to be culturally taboo. Sex- and/or gender-related features • Males are more likely to experience obsessive-compulsive disorder during childhood, with approximately 25% experiencing onset before the age of 10 years. During adulthood, prevalence is higher among females. • Males are more likely to experience co-occurring primary tic disorders. • Gender differences in the specific content of obsessions and compulsions have been reported, whereby females are more likely to report cleaning and contamination-related themes, and males are more likely to report symmetry-related themes and taboo intrusive thoughts (e.g. violent impulses, sacrilegious images). • Onset or exacerbation of obsessive-compulsive disorder has been reported during the peripartum period.
