The disorders can co-occur, and some adults with disorders of intellectual development are at greater and earlier risk of developing dementia. For example, individuals with Down syndrome who exhibit a marked decline in adaptive behaviour functioning should be evaluated for the emergence of dementia. In cases in which the diagnostic requirements for both a disorder of intellectual development and dementia are met and describe non-redundant aspects of the clinical presentation, both diagnoses may be assigned. Boundary with other mental and behavioural disorders Other mental and behavioural disorders such as schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders may include symptoms that interfere with intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour. A disorder of intellectual development should not be diagnosed if the limitations are better accounted for by another mental and behavioural disorder. However, other mental and behavioural disorders are at least as prevalent in individuals with disorders of intellectual development as in the general population, and co-occurring diagnoses should be assigned if warranted. In evaluating mental and behavioural disorders in individuals with disorders of intellectual development, signs and symptoms must be assessed using methods that are appropriate to the individual’s level of development and intellectual functioning, and may require a greater reliance on observable signs and the reports of others who are familiar with the individual. Boundary with sensory impairments If not addressed, sensory impairments (e.g. visual, auditory) can interfere with opportunities for learning, resulting in apparent limitations in intellectual functioning or adaptive behaviour. If the observed limitations are solely attributable to a sensory impairment, a disorder of intellectual development should not be assigned. However, prolonged sensory impairment throughout the critical period of development may result in the persistence of limitations in intellectual functioning or adaptive behaviour, despite later intervention, and an additional diagnosis of a disorder of intellectual development may be warranted in such cases. Boundary with effects of psychosocial deprivation Extreme psychosocial deprivation in early childhood can produce severe and selective impairments in specific mental functions such as language, social interaction and emotional expression. Depending on the onset, level of severity and duration of the deprivation, functioning in these areas may improve substantially after the child is moved to a more positive environment. However, some deficits may persist even after a sustained period in an environment that provides adequate stimulation for development, and a diagnosis of a disorder of intellectual development may be appropriate in such cases if all diagnostic requirements are met. Boundary with neurodegenerative diseases Neurodegenerative diseases can be associated with disorders of intellectual development but only if they have their onset in the developmental period (e.g. mucolipidosis type I, Gaucher’s disease type III). If a neurodegenerative disease co-occurs with a disorder of intellectual development, both diagnoses should be assigned. Boundary with secondary neurodevelopmental syndrome If the diagnostic requirements of a disorder of intellectual development are met and the symptoms are attributed to medical conditions with onset during the prenatal or developmental period, both disorder of intellectual development and the underlying medical conditions should be diagnosed. If the diagnostic requirements of a disorder of intellectual development are not met (e.g. limitations in intellectual functioning without limitations in adaptive functioning) and the symptoms are attributed to medical conditions with onset during the prenatal or developmental period, a diagnosis of secondary neurodevelopmental syndrome should be assigned, together with the diagnosis corresponding to the underlying medical condition.
