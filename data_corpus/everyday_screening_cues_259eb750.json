In cases where the underlying pathology and etiology for neurocognitive disorders can be determined, the diagnosis corresponding to the identified etiology should also be assigned. General cultural considerations for neurocognitive disorders • Performance during clinical assessment may vary according to cultural and/or linguistic factors. When assessing impairment in neurocognitive functioning and activities of daily living, cultural and linguistic factors should be considered and accounted for when possible, as in the following examples. • Test performance may be affected by cultural biases (e.g. references in test items to terminology or objects not common to a culture) and limitations of translation and adaptation. • In evaluating functioning in important everyday skills, the expectations of the individual’s culture and social environment should be considered. • Similarly, when determining the presence of perceived or observed cognitive change, it is important to consider cultural variations that may exist regarding expectations or tolerance for cognitive change. For example, some degree of memory loss or cognitive impairment might be seen as normal in some family or social systems, and may not be fully recognized when existing support systems are available to compensate.
