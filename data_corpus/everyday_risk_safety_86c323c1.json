Low prevalence of alcohol use in some countries is related to lower rates of disorders due to use of alcohol. Polymorphisms of the genes for the alcohol-metabolizing enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH1B) and aldehyde dehydrogenase, which affect the response to alcohol, are seen more frequently among East Asians than other groups. Individuals with certain polymorphisms may develop facial flushing and palpitations when consuming alcohol, which may be so severe as to preclude alcohol consumption and thus lower the risk of alcohol use disorder. 6C41 Disorders due to use of cannabis Disorders due to use of cannabis are characterized by the pattern and consequences of cannabis use. Cannabis is the collective term for a range of psychoactive preparations of the cannabis plant, Cannabis sativa, and related species and hybrids. Cannabis contains cannabinoids, a class of diverse chemical compounds that act on endogenous cannabinoid receptors that modulate neurotransmitter release in the brain. The principal psychoactive cannabinoid is δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Cannabis is typically smoked in the form of the flowering heads or leaves of the marijuana plant; tobacco is often mixed with cannabis when smoked. Cannabis oils are also prepared from these same sources. These preparations vary considerably in their THC potency. Cannabis has predominantly central nervous system depressant effects; it produces a characteristic euphoria that may be part of the presenting features of cannabis intoxication, which may also include impairment in cognitive and psychomotor functioning. Cannabis has dependence-producing properties resulting in cannabis dependence in some people and cannabis withdrawal when use is reduced or discontinued. Cannabis is associated with a range of cannabis-induced mental disorders. Other medical conditions are also associated with cannabis use, including some respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug worldwide, but its legal status varies considerably; in certain countries it is legally available for medicinal or personal use. Acceptance of cannabis use for recreational or medical purposes also varies widely by culture. Variations in legal status and cultural acceptability are related to differential consequences for detection of use (e.g. arrest, school suspension or employment suspension), affecting the probability that the person may seek treatment. 6C42 Disorders due to use of synthetic cannabinoids Disorders due to use of synthetic cannabinoids are characterized by the pattern and consequences of synthetic cannabinoid use. Synthetic cannabinoids are synthesized diverse chemical compounds that are potent agonists for endogenous cannabinoid receptors. There are several hundred such compounds. The synthetic compound is typically sprayed onto a vehicle such as cannabis or tea leaves and then smoked. The effect of these compounds is distinctly different from smoking naturally cultivated cannabis, in that the euphoric effects are typically accompanied or dominated by psychotic-like symptoms (e.g. paranoia, hallucinations and disorganized Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours | Substance classes",
