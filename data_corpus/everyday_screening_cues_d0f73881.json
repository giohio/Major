Boundary with cyclothymic disorder Although, in general, depressive periods in cyclothymic disorder are not sufficient to meet the diagnostic requirements for a depressive episode, there may be instances in which the symptoms are severe enough to constitute a depressive episode. In such cases, if there is no history of hypomanic episodes, single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder may be diagnosed, as appropriate, along with cyclothymic disorder. Boundary with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders Individuals with single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder can exhibit psychotic symptoms, but these occur only during depressive episodes. Conversely, individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders may experience significant depressive symptoms during psychotic episodes. In such cases, if the depressive symptoms do not meet the diagnostic requirements for a depressive episode, the depressive mood symptoms specifier may be applied to the psychotic disorder diagnosis. If all diagnostic requirements for both a depressive episode and schizophrenia are met concurrently or within a few days of each other, the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder should be assigned rather than single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder. However, a diagnosis of single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder can co-occur with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or another primary psychotic disorder, and both diagnoses may be assigned if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met, and psychotic symptoms are present outside of depressive episodes. Boundary with generalized anxiety disorder Generalized anxiety disorder and depressive episodes in single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder can share several features, such as somatic symptoms of anxiety, difficulty with concentration, sleep disruption and feelings of dread associated with pessimistic thoughts. Single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder are differentiated by the presence of low mood or loss of pleasure in previously enjoyable activities and other characteristic symptoms of a depressive episode (e.g. appetite changes, feelings of worthlessness, recurrent thoughts of death). In generalized anxiety disorder, individuals are focused on potential negative outcomes that might occur in a variety of everyday aspects of life (e.g. family, finances, work) rather than thoughts of worthlessness or hopelessness. Rumination often occurs in the context of single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder but, unlike in generalized anxiety disorder, is not usually accompanied by persistent worry and apprehension about various everyday aspects of life. Generalized anxiety disorder may co-occur with single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder, but should only be diagnosed if the diagnostic requirements for generalized anxiety disorder were met prior to the onset of or following complete remission of a depressive episode. Boundary with other anxiety and fear-related disorders Symptoms of anxiety, including panic attacks, are common in single episode depressive disorder and recurrent depressive disorder, and in some individuals may be a prominent aspect of the clinical presentation. In such cases, the with prominent anxiety symptoms specifier should be applied to the diagnosis for non-panic anxiety symptoms. If the anxiety symptoms meet the diagnostic requirements for an anxiety or fear-related disorder, the appropriate diagnosis from the anxiety and fear-related disorders grouping should also be assigned.
