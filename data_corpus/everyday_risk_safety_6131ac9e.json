Boundary with mood disorders In depressive disorders with psychotic symptoms, somatic delusions related to a perceived odour can occur (e.g. that their flesh is rotting and smells fetid), but typically these are an integral part of a range of preoccupations or delusions (e.g. related to guilt, nihilism, poverty) and occur alongside other depressive symptoms (e.g. loss of interest in pleasurable activities, suicidality, sleep disturbances and weight loss or gain).
