In older children and adults, repetitive behaviours such as leg shaking, finger drumming/tapping or self- stimulatory behaviours (e.g. masturbation) may be seen in response to boredom. These behaviours are differentiated from stereotyped movement disorder because they do not result in significant interference with normal daily activities; nor do they result in self- inflicted bodily injury that is severe enough to be an independent focus of clinical attention. Course features • Among typically developing children, stereotyped movements remit over time (or become suppressed). Among individuals with a disorder of intellectual development and autism spectrum disorder with disorder of intellectual development, however, stereotyped (and self-injurious) behaviours may persist, though the presentation of these behaviours may change over time. Developmental presentations • Onset of stereotyped movement disorder occurs early in the developmental period, with stereotyped movements often emerging before 3 years of age; up to 80% of children who exhibit complex motor stereotyped movements display them before 2 years of age. • Stereotyped movements are common in typically developing children, and often resolve with time – particularly simple stereotyped movements (such as rocking). The development of complex stereotyped movements is estimated to occur in 3–4% of children. • Stereotyped movement disorder commonly co-occurs with disorders of intellectual development and autism spectrum disorder. Sex- and/or gender-related features • Preschool-aged boys with autism spectrum disorder and with a disorder of intellectual development tend to have higher rates of co-occurring stereotyped movement disorder.
