Perspiration or chills, nausea or vomiting, and palpitations may be experienced. Physical signs may include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, pupillary dilatation, dyskinesia and dystonia, and skin sores. Additional features • In rare instances – usually in severe intoxication – use of stimulants, including amfetamines, methamfetamine and methcathinone, can result in seizures. Synthetic cathinones Presenting features of synthetic cathinone intoxication may include anxiety, anger, impaired attention, hypervigilance, psychomotor agitation, paranoid ideation (possibly of delusional intensity), transient auditory hallucinations, transient confusion and changes in sociability. Perspiration or chills, nausea or vomiting, and palpitations may be experienced. Physical signs may include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, pupillary dilatation, dyskinesia and dystonia, and skin sores. Additional features • In rare instances – usually in severe intoxication – use of synthetic cathinones can result in seizures. Caffeine Presenting features of caffeine intoxication may include restlessness, anxiety, excitement, insomnia, flushed face, tachycardia, diuresis, gastrointestinal disturbances, muscle twitching, psychomotor agitation, perspiration or chills, and nausea or vomiting. Cardiac arrythmias may occur. Disturbances typical of caffeine intoxication tend to occur at relatively high doses (e.g. >1 g per day). Additional features • Caffeine and related alkaloids (e.g. theobromine in tea) are present in a variety of foods (e.g. chocolate, kola nuts), beverages (e.g. sodas, guarana) and supplements (e.g. tablets, vitamins) that are consumed regularly and pervasively. • Very high doses of caffeine (e.g. >5 g) can result in respiratory distress or seizures, and can be fatal. Hallucinogens Presenting features of hallucinogen intoxication may include hallucinations, illusions, perceptual changes such as depersonalization, derealization, synaesthesias (blending of senses, such as a visual stimulus evoking a smell), anxiety, depressed or dysphoric mood, ideas of reference, paranoid ideation, impaired judgement, palpitations, sweating, blurred vision, tremors and lack of coordination. Physical signs may include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure and pupillary dilatation. Additional features • In rare instances, hallucinogen intoxication may increase suicidal behaviour.
