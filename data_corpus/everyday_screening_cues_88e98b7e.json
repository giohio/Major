When the behaviour problems occur primarily in the context of mood disturbance, a separate diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder should not be assigned. However, both diagnoses may be assigned if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met, and the behaviour problems associated with oppositional defiant disorder are observed outside of periods of mood disturbance. The oppositional defiant disorder with chronic irritability-anger specifier may be used if appropriate. Boundary with personality disorder Individuals with personality disorder may exhibit impulsivity or mood instability, but cyclothymic disorder does not include persistent problems in self-functioning and interpersonal dysfunction that characterize personality disorder. Personality disorder should be assessed outside the context of a mood episode to avoid conflating symptoms of a mood episode with personality traits, but both diagnoses may be assigned if the diagnostic requirements for each are fulfilled. Boundary with secondary mood syndrome Chronic mood instability that is a manifestation of another medical condition should be diagnosed as secondary mood syndrome rather than cyclothymic disorder. Boundary with substance-induced mood disorder Chronic mood instability due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (e.g. benzodiazepines), including withdrawal effects (e.g. from stimulants), should be diagnosed as substance-induced mood disorder rather than cyclothymic disorder. 6A6Y Other specified bipolar or related disorder Essential (required) features • The presentation is characterized by manic or hypomanic symptoms (with or without depressive symptoms) that share primary clinical features with other bipolar and related disorders (e.g. persistent elevation of mood). • The symptoms do not fulfil the diagnostic requirements for any other disorder in the bipolar and related disorders grouping. • The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder (e.g. schizoaffective disorder, a disorder due to addictive behaviours, a personality disorder). • The symptoms and behaviours are not a manifestation of another medical condition, and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication (e.g. alcohol, cocaine) on the central nervous system, including withdrawal effects. • The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.
