Caffeine Presenting features of caffeine withdrawal may include headache, marked fatigue or drowsiness, irritability, depressed or dysphoric mood, nausea or vomiting, and difficulty concentrating. Additional features: • The severity and duration of caffeine withdrawal is related to the amount, frequency and duration of caffeine use prior to cessation of use. • Onset of caffeine withdrawal is typically 12–48 hours after the last use and may last up to 7 days. Nicotine Presenting features of nicotine withdrawal may include depressed or dysphoric mood, insomnia, irritability, anger, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, restlessness, bradycardia, increased appetite, and craving for tobacco or other nicotine-containing products. Other physical symptoms may include increased cough and mouth ulceration. Additional features: • The severity and duration of nicotine withdrawal is variable, related to the amount, frequency and duration of tobacco smoked (or otherwise consumed) or of nicotine products taken prior to cessation of use. • Onset of nicotine withdrawal is typically 6–24 hours after cessation or reduction of use. Psychological and physiological features typically last up to 10 days. Physical features such as increased cough and mouth ulceration may persist for 2–3 weeks. • Craving for tobacco (or other nicotine-containing products) is prominent throughout the duration of nicotine withdrawal. Volatile inhalants Presenting features of volatile inhalant withdrawal may include insomnia, anxiety, irritability, depressed or dysphoric mood, shakiness, perspiration, nausea and transient illusions. Additional features: • The severity and duration of volatile inhalant withdrawal is related to the type of inhalant used and to the amount, frequency and duration of use of the specific inhalant. • Volatile inhalant withdrawal may be accompanied by persisting features of volatile inhalant intoxication or its medical complications, such as encephalopathy – especially when the inhalant used is lead-containing petrol/gasoline. MDMA or related Presenting features of MDMA or related drug withdrawal may include fatigue, lethargy, drugs, including MDA hypersomnia or insomnia, depressed mood, anxiety, irritability, craving, difficulty in concentrating and appetite disturbance. Additional features • The above information primarily concerns withdrawal from MDMA. There is insufficient information on the features and course of the withdrawal state from drugs related to MDMA, including MDA, to fully characterize the associated withdrawal states. • MDMA withdrawal is uncommon, reflecting the comparative rarity of MDMA dependence. • Onset of MDMA withdrawal typically occurs within 12–24 hours after last use, as blood concentrations decline.
