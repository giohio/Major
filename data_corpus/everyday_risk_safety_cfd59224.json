Men also appear more likely to recover without intervention than women. Although onset among women tends to be later, symptoms often intensify more quickly. Women are more likely to seek treatment sooner than men, though treatment-seeking is low (less than 10%) across both genders. • Women with gambling disorder are more likely to have co-occurring mood disorders or anxiety and fear-related disorders, whereas men are more likely to exhibit problems with substance abuse and externalizing behaviours. Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis) Boundary with hazardous gambling or betting The category of hazardous gambling or betting from Chapter 24 on factors influencing health status or contact with health services may be assigned to individuals who exhibit problematic patterns of gambling without the other features of gambling disorder. Hazardous gambling or betting refers to a pattern of gambling that appreciably increases the risk of harmful physical or mental health consequences, to the individual or to others around the individual, that may require intervention or monitoring but is not considered a disorder. Boundary with gaming disorder Unlike gambling disorder, gaming disorder does not involve the betting of money or other valuables with the hope of obtaining something of greater value. If gaming behaviour is focused on wagers (e.g. internet poker), gambling disorder is generally the more appropriate diagnosis. Boundary with bipolar and related disorders Increased goal-directed activity – including impaired ability to control gambling behaviour – can occur during manic, mixed or hypomanic episodes. A diagnosis of gambling disorder should only be assigned if there is evidence of a persistent pattern of gambling behaviour that meets all diagnostic requirements for the disorder, and occurs outside of mood episodes. Some individuals with gambling disorder may exhibit symptoms while gambling that appear similar to those observed during manic episodes (e.g. euphoric mood and increased energy level). However, in mood episodes, such symptoms are not limited to the gambling context. Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorder Gambling behaviour can sometimes be described as “compulsive” by lay people and also by some health professionals. Compulsions observed in obsessive-compulsive disorder are almost never experienced as inherently pleasurable; they typically occur in response to intrusive, unwanted and generally anxiety-provoking obsessions, which is not the case with gambling behaviour in gambling disorder.
