These symptoms are also typically accompanied by gait abnormalities and urinary incontinence. • Brain imaging to reveal ventricular volume and characterize brain displacement is often necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

Additional clinical features • Dementia due to injury to the head is caused by damage inflicted on the tissues of the brain as the direct or indirect result of an external force. • Trauma to the brain is known to have resulted in loss of consciousness, amnesia, disorientation and confusion, and/or neurological signs. • The symptoms characteristic of dementia due to injury to the head arise immediately following the trauma or after the individual gains consciousness, and must include persistent cognitive impairments following any recovery of initial cognitive impairment that may be seen in the immediate post-injury period. • Neurocognitive deficits vary depending on the specific brain areas affected and the severity of the injury, but can include impairments in attention, memory, executive functioning, personality,",
