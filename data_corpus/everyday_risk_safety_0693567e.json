Note: if living areas are uncluttered, this is only due to the intervention of third parties (e.g. family members, cleaners, authorities). Accumulation occurs due to both: • repetitive urges or behaviours related to amassing items, which may be passive (e.g. accumulation of incoming flyers or mail) or active (e.g. excessive acquisition of free, purchased or stolen items); and • difficulty discarding possessions due to a perceived need to save items, and distress associated with discarding them. • The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Insight specifiers Individuals with hoarding disorder vary in the degree to which they recognize that hoarding- related beliefs and behaviours (pertaining to excessive acquisition, difficulty discarding, or clutter) are problematic. For example, some can acknowledge that their living space presents a hazard, that many of the items they save are without value and unlikely to be of future use, or that their distress associated with discarding items is not rational. Others are convinced that their hoarding-related beliefs and behaviours are not problematic, despite evidence to the contrary, and the beliefs of some may at times appear to be delusional in the degree of conviction or fixity with which these beliefs are held (e.g. an individual insists that items that objectively have little or no value are critically important to save, or denies that there is any problem with their living space). Insight may vary substantially even over short periods of time – for example, depending on the level of current anxiety or distress – such as when a family member or other person forces the individual to discard items. The degree of insight that an individual exhibits in the context of hoarding disorder can be specified as follows. 6B24.0 Hoarding disorder with fair to good insight • Much of the time, the individual recognizes that hoarding-related beliefs and behaviours (pertaining to excessive acquisition, difficulty discarding, or clutter) are problematic. This specifier level may still be applied if, at circumscribed times (e.g. when being forced to discard items), the individual demonstrates no insight.
