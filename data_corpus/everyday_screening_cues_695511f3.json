Increased psychomotor activity • Any of the following: extreme hyperactivity or agitation for no reason with nonpurposeful movements and/or uncontrollable, extreme emotional reactions; impulsivity (sudden engagement in inappropriate behaviour without provocation); combativeness (striking out against others usually in an undirected manner, with or without the potential for injury) (Note: multiple manifestations of increased psychomotor activity should only be counted as one of the required three symptoms in order to meet the requirements for catatonia.) Abnormal psychomotor activity • Grimacing: odd or distorted facial expressions; often inappropriate and irrelevant to the situation • Mannerisms: odd, purposeful movements that are not appropriate to the individual’s cultural context; exaggerated caricatures of mundane movements • Posturing: spontaneous and active maintenance of a posture against gravity; sitting or standing for long periods without reacting • Stereotypy: repetitive, non-goal-directed motor activity (e.g. finger-play, repeatedly touching, patting or rubbing self) (Note: the abnormality is not inherent in the action but relates to its frequency.) • Rigidity: resistance by way of increased muscle tone, which may range in severity from mildly increased tone to severe “lead pipe” rigidity (requires examination) • Echophenomena: mimicking examiner’s speech (echolalia) or movements (echopraxia) • Verbigeration: continuous and directionless repetition of words, phrases or sentences • Waxy flexibility: slight and even resistance to positioning by examiner (requires examination) Catatonia | General diagnostic requirements for catatonia",
