Note: harm to the health of the person to whom the diagnosis applies includes injuries caused by behaviour related to intoxication (e.g. impulsive aggressive behaviour, psychomotor impairment leading to injury; see Table 6.15, p. 475); acute health problems resulting from substance use (e.g. overdose, acute gastritis, the effects of hypoxia or prolonged hyperactivity or inactivity), and exacerbation or decompensation of pre-existing chronic health problems (e.g. hypertension, liver disease, or peptic ulceration). Harm may also result from a harmful route of administration (e.g. injecting drug use causing bloodborne virus infections, cocaine use causing a perforated nasal septum). The relevant diagnostic codes from other ICD-11 chapters – including Chapter 22 on injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes – should be used to describe the specific health consequences of the harmful substance use. Harm to the health of others includes any form of physical harm, including trauma (e.g. impaired driving causing a motor vehicle accident, assaultive behaviour leading to bodily harm to another person) or mental disorder (e.g. post-traumatic stress disorder arising from an assault by the intoxicated individual) that is directly attributable to behaviour due to substance intoxication on the part of the person to whom the diagnosis of harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use applies.
