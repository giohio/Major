Individuals with olfactory reference disorder do not exhibit other features of psychosis (e.g. hallucinations or formal thought disorder). Boundary with mood disorders In depressive disorders with psychotic symptoms, somatic delusions related to a perceived odour can occur (e.g. that their flesh is rotting and smells fetid), but typically these are an integral part of a range of preoccupations or delusions (e.g. related to guilt, nihilism, poverty) and occur alongside other depressive symptoms (e.g. loss of interest in pleasurable activities, suicidality, sleep disturbances and weight loss or gain).

Boundary with social anxiety disorder Individuals with olfactory reference disorder may avoid social situations specifically because they believe they are emitting a foul odour. In contrast, in social anxiety disorder, social situations are avoided because the individual is concerned that they will act in a way, or show anxiety symptoms, that will be negatively evaluated by others (i.e. be humiliating, be embarrassing, lead to rejection or be offensive). 6B23 Hypochondriasis (health anxiety disorder) Essential (required) features • Persistent preoccupation or fear about the possibility of having one or more serious, progressive or life-threatening illnesses is required for diagnosis. • The preoccupation is accompanied by either: • repetitive and excessive health-related behaviours, such as repeatedly checking of the body for evidence of illness, spending inordinate amounts of time searching for information about the feared illness or repeatedly seeking reassurance (e.g. arranging multiple medical consultations); or • maladaptive avoidance behaviour related to health (e.g. avoiding medical appointments). • The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.
