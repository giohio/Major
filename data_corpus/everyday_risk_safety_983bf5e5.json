Course features • Onset of dissociative neurological symptom disorder typically occurs between puberty and early adulthood; although onset in early childhood (as young as the age of 3 years) has been observed, it is extremely rare. Onset after the age of 35 years is uncommon. • The onset of dissociative neurological symptom disorder is usually acute, and the disorder may follow either a transient or a persistent course. Symptoms are typically of brief duration (e.g. remission within 2 weeks) but commonly recur. • Onset is often associated with a traumatic or adverse life event. Prior physical injury and a history of childhood abuse or neglect are risk factors for dissociative neurological symptom disorder. In addition, a prior disease of the nervous system is a risk factor for the disorder; for example, individuals with a history of epilepsy are more likely to exhibit non-epileptic seizures. Patients may also present with symptoms that closely resemble the symptoms of physical illnesses experienced by their friends or family members. • Non-epileptic seizures are more likely to have their onset earlier in the lifespan than motor symptoms. • Positive prognostic factors include younger age, acute onset, onset associated with a clearly identifiable stressor, early diagnosis, monosymptomatic presentation, short duration of symptoms, and short interval between symptom onset and initiation of treatment. Patients with good premorbid adjustment and above-average intelligence, and those who accept the psychological nature of the disorder also have a better prognosis. Negative prognostic factors include non-transient symptoms, polysymptomatic presentation, the presence of comorbid medical conditions and co-occurring mental disorders (e.g. mood disorders or anxiety and fear-related disorders). Patients with maladaptive personality traits, history of sexual abuse or poor physical functioning prior to diagnosis also have a poorer prognosis. • Individuals with symptoms of paralysis, aphonia, blindness or deafness tend to have a better prognosis than those with symptoms of tremor or non-epileptic seizures. Developmental presentations • Onset of dissociative neurological symptom disorder in childhood is often associated with minor illness or physical injury.
