(continued) Summary of recommendations Module and Recommendation recommendation Strength of the recommendation and certainty of the evidence number EPI3 (update) 3.2 Focal onset seizures: (continued) Monotherapy with lamotrigine or levetiracetam should be offered as first-line treatment for focal onset seizures in children and adults with epilepsy. If neither lamotrigine nor levetiracetam are available, then carbamazepine should be used as an alternate first-line treatment for focal onset seizures in children and adults with epilepsy. If the first monotherapy is not successful for focal onset seizures, an alternative first-line monotherapy should be tried. Lacosamide should be offered as a second-line monotherapy for focal onset seizures if none of the first-line medicines are effective. If antiseizure medicine monotherapy is unsuccessful in people with generalized onset seizures or focal onset seizures, prompt referral should be made to a specialist for consideration of other treatment options. Strong recommendation. High certainty of evidence. EPI4 (update) 4.1 The efficacy of antiseizure medicines (ASMs) is not thought to differ in males and females. As such, this recommendation builds on EPI3 and focuses on the medicines that are now being preferentially recommended as therapeutic options. In women and girls with epilepsy who are of childbearing potential, lamotrigine or levetiracetam should be offered as first-line monotherapy for both generalized onset seizures and focal onset seizures. Women with epilepsy should have seizures controlled as well as possible with the minimum dose of ASMs taken in monotherapy, wherever possible. Valproic acid (sodium valproate) is not recommended in women and girls of childbearing potential because of potential harm to the fetus. Strong recommendation. Very low certainty of evidence. 4.2 Standard breastfeeding recommendations remain appropriate for women with epilepsy taking the ASMs included in this review (phenobarbital, phenytoin, valproic acid [sodium valproate], carbamazepine, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, topiramate, lacosamide).
