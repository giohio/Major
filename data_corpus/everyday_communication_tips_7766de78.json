For example, alcohol dependence may occur after a lower cumulative alcohol intake in women compared to men because of sex-related differences in body mass and composition. • Women are less likely to be involved with the legal system in relation to substance use, and therefore may be less likely to come to clinical attention than men. In clinical contexts, women may be reluctant to admit using substances due to prevailing social attitudes and proscriptions. • In some societies it may be culturally unacceptable for women to admit to substance use. Specific probing may be necessary to elicit a history of substance use and dependence. Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis) Boundary with substance intoxication Episodic or continuous intoxication with substances is a typical feature of substance dependence, but is not an essential feature. Conversely, even if frequent and severe, substance intoxication alone is not a basis for a diagnosis of substance dependence. If all diagnostic requirements of both conditions are met for the same episode of care, substance dependence should be assigned as the primary diagnosis, with an associated diagnosis of substance intoxication (e.g. opioid dependence with opioid intoxication) if appropriate to the specific clinical situation (e.g. in emergency settings). Boundary with harmful substance use Substance dependence is often associated with physical and mental health consequences, such as those seen in harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use. In the absence of the essential features of substance dependence, a diagnosis of harmful substance use can be given when there has been demonstrable harm to the individual’s physical or mental health or the health of others. Harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use and substance dependence should not be diagnosed together.
