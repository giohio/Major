It may be appropriate to apply a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder to some behavioural patterns of ataque de nervios involving paroxysmal violence and destruction of property. • The typical level of expressed emotionality varies cross-culturally, including by gender and age. Cultural minorities, immigrants or individuals in post-conflict settings may be at risk of being mislabelled as excessively angry because of this variation. Moreover, clinicians may misattribute anger to a single triggering event when it is in reaction to the accumulation of multiple environmental stressors (e.g. discrimination, losses, displacement, limited social support, powerlessness, injustice). Clinicians should consider the larger social context and how it may be related to the expression of anger before assigning a diagnosis. Sex- and/or gender-related features • Although it was originally believed that intermittent explosive disorder was much more prevalent among males, recent community surveys suggest similar prevalence rates by gender.

These outbursts are usually associated with a specific trigger that is related to the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (e.g. a change in routine, aversive sensory stimulation, anxiety, rigidity when the individual’s thoughts or behaviours are interrupted). Individuals with intermittent explosive disorder do not exhibit other features of social communication difficulties and restricted or repetitive behaviours that are characteristic of autism spectrum disorder. Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Intermittent explosive disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are both characterized by impulsive behaviour.
