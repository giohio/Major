Dissociative disorders | Dissociative amnesia Dissociative disorders 377 Boundary with disorders due to substance use Amnesia is common in disorders due to substance use – particularly alcohol-related disorders (e.g. “alcohol blackouts”). If amnesia occurs exclusively in the context of alcohol or drug use, a diagnosis of dissociative amnesia is not warranted. However, differential diagnosis may be complicated in cases in which an individual with a history of dissociative amnestic episodes also uses alcohol or other substances. Boundary with memory deficits in neurocognitive disorders, head trauma and medical conditions classified elsewhere Neurocognitive disorders – including delirium, amnestic disorder and dementia – are characterized by primary acquired clinical deficits in cognitive functioning, frequently including significant and pervasive memory impairment. In neurocognitive disorders, a specific etiological factor or underlying disease process can often be identified. Memory loss may also occur as a result of a brain injury, or as an effect of some diseases of the nervous system or medical conditions classified elsewhere (e.g. a brain tumour). In dissociative amnesia, memory loss is primarily for autobiographical memories, and no underlying disease process or injury that represents a potential etiology for the memory impairment can be identified. Trance disorder and possession trance disorder Trance disorder and possession trance disorder are characterized by recurrent or single and prolonged involuntary marked alteration in an individual’s state of consciousness involving either a trance state (without possession) or a possession trance state. The distinctive feature of possession trance disorder is that the individual’s normal sense of personal identity is replaced by an external “possessing” identity attributed to the influence of a spirit, power, deity or other spiritual entity, which does not occur in trance disorder. In addition, in possession trance disorder a greater range of more complex behaviours may be exhibited, which are experienced as being controlled by the possessing agent, whereas trance disorder typically involves the repetition of a small repertoire of behaviours. Most trance or possession trance states are brief and transitory, and are related to cultural and religious experiences. These experiences are not considered pathological, and a diagnosis should not be assigned based on their occurrence. Trance and possession trance states should only be considered to be features of a mental disorder when they are involuntary and unwanted, not accepted as a part of a collective cultural or religious practice, and result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Because of the substantial similarity between these disorders, following a separate listing of the essential (required) features of each, the other CDDR elements are provided for the two categories together.
