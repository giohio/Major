If all diagnostic requirements for both a depressive, manic or mixed episode and schizophrenia are met concurrently or within a few days of each other, and other diagnostic requirements are met, the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder should be assigned rather than bipolar type I or bipolar type II disorder. A hypomanic episode superimposed on schizophrenia does not qualify for a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. However, a diagnosis of bipolar type I or bipolar type II disorder can co-occur with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or another primary psychotic disorder, and both diagnoses may be assigned if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met and psychotic symptoms are present outside of mood episodes. Boundary with anxiety and fear-related disorders Symptoms of anxiety, including panic attacks, are common in bipolar type I and bipolar type II disorders, and in some individuals may be a prominent aspect of the clinical presentation. In such cases, the with prominent anxiety symptoms specifier should be applied to the diagnosis for non-panic anxiety systems. If the anxiety symptoms meet the diagnostic requirements for an anxiety or fear-related disorder, the appropriate diagnosis from the anxiety or fear-related disorders grouping should also be assigned. For panic attacks, if these occur entirely in the context of anxiety associated with depressive, hypomanic, manic or mixed episodes in bipolar type I and bipolar type II disorders, they are appropriately designated using the with panic attacks specifier. However, if panic attacks also occur outside of symptomatic mood episodes, and other diagnostic requirements are met, a separate diagnosis of panic disorder should be considered. Both specifiers may be assigned if warranted. Boundary with personality disorder Individuals with a personality disorder may exhibit impulsivity or mood instability, but personality disorder does not include depressive, hypomanic, manic or mixed episodes. However, co-occurrence of personality disorder and bipolar type I and bipolar type II disorders is relatively common. Symptoms of personality disorder should be assessed outside the context of a mood episode to avoid conflating symptoms of a mood episode with personality traits, but both diagnoses may be assigned if the diagnostic requirements for each are met. Boundary with oppositional defiant disorder It is common, particularly among children and adolescents, for patterns of noncompliance and symptoms of irritability/anger to arise as part of a mood disorder. For example, noncompliance may be a result of depressive symptoms (e.g. diminished interest or pleasure in activities, difficulty concentrating, hopelessness, psychomotor retardation, reduced energy). During hypomanic or manic episodes, individuals are less likely to follow rules and comply with directions. Oppositional defiant disorder often co-occurs with mood disorders, and irritability/anger can be a common symptom across these disorders.
