  "text_en": "32 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders The diagnostic code 6A71.3/6A80.3, for example, indicates recurrent depressive disorder, current episode severe, without psychotic symptoms (6A71.3), with melancholia (6A80.3). Another form of postcoordination is through the use of “extension codes”, which are generic codes that can be applied across the categories in the different chapters of ICD-11. Extension codes for severity – none (XS8H), mild (XS5W), moderate (XS0T) and severe (XS25) – are used in several places in the ICD-11 chapter on mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders. Extension codes are appended to the diagnostic code they are modifying using an ampersand (&). For example, 6D80&XS0T is the code for dementia due to Alzheimer disease (6D80) of moderate severity (XS0T). Extension codes can also be used to indicate a provisional diagnosis (XY7Z) or to designate a differential diagnosis (XY75). For example, 6A02&XY7Z is the code to indicate a provisional diagnosis (XY7Z) of autism spectrum disorder (6A02). The coding for schizophrenia illustrates how a combination of precoordinated and postcoordinated codes, including extension codes for severity, can be used to characterize course and symptomatic manifestations more fully. Clinical course of schizophrenia is indicated using a combination of fifth-character codes (“0” for first episode, “1” for multiple episodes, “2” for continuous course) and sixth-character codes (“0” for currently symptomatic, “1” for in partial remission, “2” for in full remission). Dimensional profiles of current symptomatic manifestations can be indicated by adding codes from the symptomatic manifestations of primary psychotic disorders that represent specific symptom domains: • 6A25.0 for positive symptoms; • 6A25.1 for negative symptoms; • 6A25.2 for depressive mood symptoms; • 6A25.3 for manic mood symptoms; • 6A25.4 for psychomotor symptoms; and • 6A25.5 for cognitive symptoms. The above codes for symptomatic manifestations of primary psychotic disorders can be used in combination with extension codes to indicate the severity of each symptom domain, respectively, thus providing a symptomatic profile of the presenting symptoms for schizophrenia for a particular individual at a particular point in time. The web-based browser for ICD-11 for MMS4 can be used to construct the diagnostic coding for those disorders with complex combinations of specifiers and extensions. For example, schizophrenia, first episode, currently symptomatic with moderate positive symptoms, with severe negative symptoms, absent depressed mood symptoms, absent manic mood symptoms, mild psychomotor symptoms and severe cognitive symptoms yields the following combined diagnostic code: 6A20.00/6A25.0&XS0T/6A25.1&XS25/6A25.2&XS8H/6A25.3&XS8H/6A25.4&XS5W/6A25.5&XS25 As indicated, generating and interpreting this type of complex, multipart code will be most feasible for relatively sophisticated electronic health information systems. It is not expected that such complex codes will be used routinely by individual clinicians recording diagnoses by hand, for example. Coding of mental disorders caused by health conditions not classified under mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders ICD-11, as was the case with ICD-10, requires that two diagnostic codes be given for symptomatic presentations of mental disorders that are judged to be a manifestation of a health condition (i.e. disorder, disease or injury) classified outside Chapter 6. 4 ICD-11 for Mortality and Morbidity Statistics (ICD-11 MMS) [website].
