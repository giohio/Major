  "text_en": "characterized by transient bouts of simple motor tics such as eye blinking or head jerks. Phonic tics usually begin 1–2 years after the onset of motor symptoms and initially tend to be simple in character (e.g. throat clearing, grunting, or squeaking), but then may gradually develop into more complex vocal symptoms that include repetition of one’s own or another person’s speech or obscene utterances (i.e. coprolalia). Sometimes the latter is associated with gestural echopraxia, which also may be of an obscene nature (i.e. copropraxia). • Vocal and/or motor tics may wax and wane in severity, with some individuals experiencing remission of symptoms for weeks or months at a time. Eventually the symptoms become more persistent, and can be accompanied by detrimental effects to personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. • The majority of individuals with Tourette syndrome will experience significantly diminished symptoms by early adulthood, with more than one third experiencing a full remission of symptoms. • Evidence suggests a good long-term clinical course for individuals with a solitary diagnosis of Tourette syndrome. Those with co-occurring conditions (e.g. obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and fear-related disorders, depressive disorders) tend to exhibit a poorer prognosis. Developmental presentations • The prevalence rate of Tourette syndrome among school-aged children has been estimated at approximately 0.5%. • Motor and phonic tics in Tourette syndrome tend to be most severe between the ages of 8 and 12 years, gradually diminishing throughout adolescence. By late childhood (approximately 10 years of age), most children become aware of premonitory urges (bodily sensations) and increased discomfort preceding – and relief of tension following – motor and vocal tics. • The vocal symptom of coprolalia (inappropriate swearing, experienced involuntarily) is uncommon, affecting only 10–15% of individuals with Tourette syndrome, and tends to emerge in mid-adolescence. • Many adults with childhood-onset Tourette syndrome report attenuated symptoms, though a small number of adults will continue to experience severe tic symptoms.
