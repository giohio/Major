  "text_en": "a significant risk of injury or death, is not considered a disorder. • The occurrence or a history of atypical sexual behaviours is not sufficient to establish a diagnosis of paraphilic disorder involving solitary behaviour or consenting individuals. Some atypical sexual behaviours may occur impulsively or opportunistically, or as a means of personal and sexual exploration, and are not associated with a sustained underlying arousal pattern. The diagnosis of paraphilic disorder involving solitary behaviour or consenting individuals requires these behaviours to be a manifestation of a sustained, focused and intense pattern of paraphilic sexual arousal, in addition to distress or significant risk of injury or death. • When distress related to an arousal pattern involving consenting adults or solitary behaviour is entirely attributable to rejection or feared rejection of the arousal pattern by others (e.g. a partner, family, society), a diagnosis of paraphilic disorder involving solitary behaviour or consenting individuals should not be assigned. Instead, categories from the grouping QA15 Counselling related to sexuality in Chapter 24 on factors influencing health status or contact with health services may be considered. • This diagnosis should not be applied to individuals who are distressed about homosexual or bisexual sexual orientation. If an individual is presenting for treatment based on such distress, categories from the grouping QA15 Counselling related to sexuality in Chapter 24 on factors influencing health status or contact with health services may be considered. If the pattern of distress-related symptoms meets the diagnostic requirements for another mental disorder (e.g. adjustment disorder, a depressive disorder, an anxiety or fear-related disorder), that diagnosis should be assigned. Course features • Individuals with paraphilic arousal patterns involving solitary behaviour or consenting individuals often report the onset of paraphilic sexual interest during adolescence. • Paraphilic arousal patterns are relatively stable after young adulthood, but sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges and behaviours, as well as any associated distress, may change over time, such that an individual who was assigned a diagnosis of a paraphilic disorder involving solitary behaviour or consenting individuals no longer meets the diagnostic requirements. Developmental presentations • Advancing age may be associated with decreasing paraphilic sexual arousal and decreasing related behavioural manifestations due to increased impulse control and decreased sexual drive.
