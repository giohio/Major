Sexual acts may occur impulsively or opportunistically during adolescence rather than representing a recurrent pattern of sexual arousal. • The diagnosis of coercive sexual sadism disorder is generally not adequately supported when the evidence indicating a sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal consists solely of a single or very limited number of instances of coercive sadistic sexual behaviour, as there may be other explanations for specific occurrences (e.g. intoxication, opportunity). In the absence of a report of the individual’s sexual thoughts, fantasies or urges, examples of other forms of evidence supporting the presence of a coercive sadistic arousal pattern include a preference for specific types of pornography; preference over other forms of sexual behaviour; planning and repeatedly seeking out opportunities to engage in coercive sadistic sexual behaviour; or laboratory measures of relative viewing time (based on the finding that preferred sexual stimuli are gazed at longer than non- preferred sexual stimuli) and/or penile plethysmography.

Course features • Individuals with coercive sexual sadism disorder often report the onset of coercive sadistic sexual interest during adolescence. • Coercive sexual sadism disorder is relatively stable after young adulthood, but sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges and behaviours may change over time, such that an individual who was assigned a diagnosis of coercive sexual sadism disorder no longer meets the diagnostic requirements. Developmental presentations • Advancing age may be associated with decreasing paraphilic sexual arousal and decreasing behavioural manifestations of coercive sexual sadism disorder due to increased impulse control and decreased sexual drive.
