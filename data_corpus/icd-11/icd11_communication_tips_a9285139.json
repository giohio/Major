Individuals may set fires for profit or to conceal a crime, as an act of revenge, to commit sabotage or make a political statement, or to attract recognition (e.g. deliberately setting a fire to then be the first one to discover it and put it out).

A diagnosis of pyromania is not appropriate under these circumstances.
