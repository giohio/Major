If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort. 6B63 Possession trance disorder Essential (required) features • Occurrence of a trance state in which there is a marked alteration in the individual’s state of consciousness, and the individual’s normal sense of personal identity is replaced by an external “possessing” identity, is required for diagnosis.
