The presence of a set of associated symptoms specific to different classes of psychoactive substances (see Table 6.16, p. 484) – as well as the frequency, amount and duration of its use and presence of substance dependence – should be considered in distinguishing substance withdrawal from a “hangover effect”. • Some individuals who have previously had substance dependence may experience symptoms similar to those of substance withdrawal months after the last use of the substance, particularly when the individual encounters stimuli (e.g. drug paraphernalia) and contexts (e.g. location where use was frequent) previously associated with past substance use.
