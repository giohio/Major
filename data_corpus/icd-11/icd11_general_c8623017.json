Receptive and expressive language skills are relatively unimpaired, but pragmatic language abilities are markedly below the expected level for the individual’s age, and interfere with functional communication to a greater degree than with other components of language (e.g. syntax, semantics). This specifier should not be used if the pragmatic language impairment occurs in the context of a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. 6A01.23 Developmental language disorder with other specified language impairment • This specifier should be applied if the developmental language disorder meets all the diagnostic requirements of the disorder but the pattern of deficits in language is not adequately characterized by one of the other available specifiers.
