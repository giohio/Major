The individual typically attempts to ignore or suppress obsessions or to neutralize them by performing compulsions. • Compulsions are repetitive behaviours or rituals, including repetitive mental acts, that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, according to rigid rules, or to achieve a sense of “completeness”. Examples of overt behaviours include repetitive washing, checking and ordering of objects. Examples of analogous mental acts include mentally repeating specific phrases in order to prevent negative outcomes, reviewing a memory to make sure that one has caused no harm, and mentally counting objects. Compulsions are either not connected in a realistic way to the feared event (e.g. arranging items symmetrically to prevent harm to a loved one) or are clearly excessive (e.g. showering daily for hours to prevent illness). • Obsessions and compulsions are time-consuming (e.g. take more than 1 hour per day) or result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort. • The symptoms or behaviours are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. basal ganglia ischaemic stroke), and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (e.g. amfetamine), including withdrawal effects.
