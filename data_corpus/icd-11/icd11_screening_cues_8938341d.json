Additional features • Nicotine intoxication occurs more commonly in people who have recently started smoking or using other forms of nicotine (e.g. electronic cigarettes or “vaping”), and have therefore not developed tolerance. It may also occur in people who receive nicotine therapeutically and take it in higher than recommended doses. • In rare instances, paranoid ideation, perceptual disturbances, convulsions or coma may occur. Volatile inhalants Presenting features of volatile inhalant intoxication may include euphoria, impaired judgement, aggression, somnolence, stupor or coma, dizziness, tremor, lack of coordination, slurred speech, unsteady gait, lethargy and apathy, psychomotor retardation and visual disturbance. Muscle weakness and diplopia may occur. Additional features • Intentional or unintentional exposure to a variety of volatile inhalant substances (e.g. glue, petrol, butane, paint) can cause the symptoms of volatile inhalant intoxication. • Intentional volatile inhalant intoxication typically involves “sniffing” or “huffing” the substances from closed containers, a practice that may lead to hypoxia, hypoxic brain damage and other long-lasting neurological sequelae. • Use of volatile inhalants may cause cardiac arrythmias, cardiac arrest and death. • Inhalants containing lead (e.g. some forms of petrol/gasoline) may cause confusion, irritability, coma and seizures. • Use of volatile inhalants is more common among adolescents and young adults due to the greater ease of access compared to other psychoactive substances. MDMA or related drugs, Presenting features of MDMA or related drug intoxication may include increased including MDA or inappropriate sexual interest and activity, anxiety, restlessness, agitation and sweating. Additional features • In rare instances – usually in severe intoxication – use of MDMA or related drugs, including MDA, can result in dystonia and seizures. Sudden death is a rare but recognized complication. Dissociative drugs, Presenting features of dissociative drug intoxication may include aggression, including ketamine and impulsivity, unpredictable behaviour, anxiety, psychomotor agitation, impaired PCP judgement, numbness or diminished responsiveness to pain, slurred speech and dystonia.",
