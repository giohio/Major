The diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in individuals with severe and profound disorders of intellectual development is particularly difficult, and requires in-depth and longitudinal assessments. Because autism spectrum disorder inherently involves social deficits, assessment of adaptive behaviour as a part of the diagnosis of a co-occurring disorder of intellectual development should place greater emphasis on the conceptual and practical domains of adaptive functioning than on social skills. Boundary with developmental learning disorders Developmental learning disorders are characterized by significant and persistent difficulties in learning academic skills including reading, writing and arithmetic, with performance in these areas markedly below what would be expected based on chronological age or intellectual level. Individuals with disorders of intellectual development often present with limitations in academic achievement by virtue of significant generalized deficits in intellectual functioning. It is therefore difficult to establish the co-occurring presence of a developmental learning disorder in individuals with a disorder of intellectual development. However, developmental learning disorders can co-occur in some individuals with disorders of intellectual development if, despite adequate opportunities, acquisition of learning is significantly below what is expected based on established intellectual functioning. In such cases, both disorders may be diagnosed. Boundary with developmental motor coordination disorders In developmental motor coordination disorder, individuals exhibit significant delays during the developmental period in the acquisition of gross and fine motor skills, and impairment in the execution of coordinated motor skills that manifest in clumsiness, slowness or inaccuracy of motor performance. Individuals with disorders of intellectual development may also display such motor coordination difficulties that affect adaptive behaviour functioning. In contrast to those with developmental motor coordination disorder, individuals with disorders of intellectual development have accompanying significant limitations in intellectual functioning. However, if coordinated motor skills are significantly below what would be expected based on level of intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour, and represent a separate focus of clinical attention, both diagnoses may be assigned. Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder In attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, individuals show a persistent and generalized pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that emerges during the developmental period. If all diagnostic requirements for a disorder of intellectual development are met, and inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity are found to be outside normal expected limits based on age and level of intellectual functioning, with significant interference in academic, occupational or social functioning, both diagnoses may be assigned. Boundary with dementia In dementia, affected individuals – usually older adults – exhibit a decline from a previous level of functioning in multiple cognitive domains that interferes significantly with performance of Neurodevelopmental disorders | Disorders of intellectual development",
