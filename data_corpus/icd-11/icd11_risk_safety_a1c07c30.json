Course features • Anorexia nervosa often has its onset during adolescence or early adulthood (i.e. between the ages of 10 and 24 years), typically following a stressful life event. Early-onset anorexia nervosa (prior to puberty) and late-onset anorexia nervosa (after the age of 40 years) are relatively rare. • Many individuals display a period of altered eating behaviours prior to meeting the full diagnostic requirements for anorexia nervosa. • Although some individuals recover fully after a single episode of anorexia nervosa, many experience a chronic course of illness over many years. • Individuals with severe symptoms of anorexia nervosa may require hospitalization to restore weight and address medical complications. These individuals are less likely to experience remission of symptoms. • Most individuals diagnosed with anorexia nervosa experience remission within 5 years of onset. However, even after an individual no longer meets the diagnostic requirements for anorexia nervosa, they are more likely to have a lower body weight and increased psychological features associated with anorexia nervosa (e.g. perfectionism) compared to the general population. • Anorexia nervosa is associated with premature death, often due to medical complications of starvation or to suicide. Developmental presentations • Children with anorexia nervosa may not be able to articulate body-image concerns and emotions related to restrictive eating. Presenting features among children may include avoidance of food intake with denial of the severity of malnutrition for reasons other than body-image concerns (e.g. reporting they are “not hungry” or have abdominal pain), as well as nonverbal forms of food refusal. • Children with anorexia nervosa are less likely to engage in binge eating and purging, or to engage in other compensatory behaviours. • The prognosis for adolescents diagnosed with anorexia nervosa is better than the prognosis for adults with anorexia nervosa.
