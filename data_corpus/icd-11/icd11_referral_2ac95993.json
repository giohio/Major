At the same time, the field study results highlighted the overall increase in complexity of this part of ICD-11 and the need for training of health professionals in order to ensure a smooth transition. The field studies also yielded specific suggestions for better delineation of the boundaries among some diagnostic categories as well as better descriptions of new ones. In addition, WHO commissioned a study (50) on the concordance among diagnoses for alcohol and cannabis use disorders based on ICD-11, ICD-10 and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth and fifth editions (DSM-IV and DSM-5) (51,52). The results of the study demonstrated high concordance among the populations identified by the ICD-11 diagnostic requirements compared to ICD-10 and DSM-IV. Concordance of between ICD-11 and DSM-5 was substantially lower, in large part due to low agreement between the diagnoses of harmful pattern of alcohol use and harmful pattern of cannabis use in ICD-11 and mild alcohol use disorder and mild cannabis use disorder in DSM-5. Development of the CDDR also included the involvement of mental health service users and carers through two studies in 15 countries representing diverse clinical contexts in multiple global regions (53,54). These studies constituted the first instance of a systematic research programme studying mental health service users’ perspectives during the revision of a major diagnostic classification system. The studies employed participatory research methodologies to systematically collate service user perspectives on key CDDR diagnoses that contribute to high disease burden, including schizophrenia, depressive episode, bipolar type I disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and personality disorder. Findings from these studies provided an understanding of how mental health service users respond to diagnostic content of the CDDR, and served as a basis for providing recommendations to WHO about potential enhancements of CDDR diagnostic material that may enhance its clinical utility (e.g. its usefulness in communicating with service users) and mitigating potential unintended negative consequences of the diagnostic material, including stigmatization of diagnosed individuals. Coordination with the development of DSM-5 The development of ICD-11 overlapped with the development and publication of DSM-5 (52). The Chair and Co-Chair of the DSM-5 Task Force regularly attended meetings of the Advisory Group in an effort to facilitate “harmonization” of the two classifications. This was most successful in terms of the way that mental disorders are divided into groupings and how those groupings are ordered in the two classifications (referred to as the “metastructure”). In this regard, ICD-11 and DSM-5 are quite similar to one another, though not identical, and substantially different from ICD- 10 and DSM-IV. Most ICD-11 working groups included at least one member of the corresponding DSM-5 workgroup. ICD-11 working groups were asked to consider the clinical utility and global applicability of material being developed for DSM-5, with the goal of minimizing unintentional or arbitrary differences between the two systems. Intentional conceptual differences were permitted, however, and the working groups were asked to provide a justification for such differences where they were proposed. The differences between ICD-11 (both the MMS and the CDDR) and DSM-5 are therefore conscious and intentional (16,55), and a number of such differences have stimulated valuable research that has enhanced our knowledge about psychopathology (56).",
