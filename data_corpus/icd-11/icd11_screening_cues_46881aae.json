Boundary with mood symptoms that are precipitated by the stress of being diagnosed with a medical condition Depending on the nature of the medical condition (e.g. a life-threatening type of cancer, a potentially fatal infection) or its onset (e.g. a heart attack, a stroke, a severe injury), mood symptoms can occur as a part of a psychological response to being diagnosed and/or having to cope with a severe medical condition. In the absence of evidence of a physiological link between the medical condition and the mood symptoms, the appropriate mental disorder (e.g. adjustment disorder, a mood disorder) rather than secondary mood syndrome should be diagnosed. Boundary with delirium due to disease classified elsewhere Mood symptoms can occur in the context of delirium due to disease classified elsewhere. Delirium is characterized by disturbed attention (i.e. reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain and shift attention) and awareness (i.e. reduced orientation to the environment) that develops over a short period of time and tends to fluctuate during the course of a day, accompanied by other cognitive impairment such as memory deficit, disorientation or impairment in language, visuospatial ability or perception. In contrast, mood symptoms in secondary mood syndrome occur in the absence of disturbed attention or severe cognitive impairment. If mood symptoms are judged to be better explained by delirium due to disease classified elsewhere, an additional diagnosis of secondary mood syndrome is not warranted. Boundary with dementia Mood symptoms can occur in the context of dementia, which is characterized by a decline from a previous level of cognitive functioning with impairment in two or more cognitive domains (e.g. memory, executive functions, attention, language, social cognition and judgement, psychomotor speed, visuoperceptual or visuospatial abilities). In contrast, secondary mood syndrome is not accompanied by marked cognitive impairment. The presence of mood symptoms in the context of dementia can be recorded using the mood symptoms in dementia specifier. If the mood symptoms are judged to be due to the same medical condition as is causing the dementia, an additional diagnosis of secondary mood syndrome is not warranted.
