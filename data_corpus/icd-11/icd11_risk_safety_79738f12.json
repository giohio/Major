Dissociative disorders | Partial dissociative identity disorder 388 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders Additional clinical features • The dissociative intrusions attributed to non-dominant personality states by individuals with partial dissociative identity disorder are experienced internally, and may not be obvious to observers. Observable identity alteration is typically indicative of dissociative identity disorder. • Individuals with partial dissociative identity disorder often do not experience amnesia during episodes of dissociative intrusions. If amnesia does occur, it is usually brief and restricted to extreme emotional states or episodes of self-harm. • Partial dissociative identity disorder is commonly associated with serious or chronic traumatic life events, including physical, sexual or emotional abuse. Boundary with normality (threshold) • The presence of distinct personality states or dissociative intrusions does not always indicate the presence of a mental disorder. In certain circumstances (e.g. as experienced by “mediums” or other culturally accepted spiritual practitioners), the presence of multiple personality states is not experienced as aversive and is not associated with impairment in functioning. A diagnosis of partial dissociative identity disorder should not be assigned in these cases. Course features • Partial dissociative identity disorder is strongly linked to traumatic experiences – especially physical, sexual and emotional abuse or childhood neglect. The onset of identity changes can also be triggered by removal from ongoing traumatizing circumstances, by death or serious illness of the perpetrator of abuse, or by other unrelated traumatic experiences later in life. • Partial dissociative identity disorder usually has a recurrent and fluctuating clinical course. Although symptoms might reduce spontaneously with age in older adults, periods of increased stress can cause recurrence of symptoms. Factors such as re-traumatization or chronically ongoing abuse tend to predict a poorer prognosis. • Partial dissociative identity disorder often co-occurs with other mental disorders. In such cases, identity alternations can influence the symptom presentation of the co-occurring disorders. Dissociative disorders | Partial dissociative identity disorder",
