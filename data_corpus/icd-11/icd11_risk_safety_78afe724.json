As such, clinicians must consider whether the reported fear, anxiety or avoidance behaviour is disproportionate to the reasonable risk of harm, taking into consideration both accepted cultural norms and the specific environmental conditions that the individual is normally subjected to (e.g. fear of darkness may be justified in a neighbourhood where assaults are common at night). Boundary with normality (threshold) • In children and adolescents, some fears may be part of normal development (e.g. a young child who is afraid of dogs). Specific phobia should only be diagnosed if the fear or anxiety is excessive in comparison to that of other individuals at a similar developmental level. Course features • Onset of specific phobia can occur at any age; however, initial onset is most common during early childhood (between 7 and 10 years of age), typically as a result of witnessing or experiencing a fear-provoking situation or event (e.g. choking, being attacked by an animal, witnessing someone drown). • Younger age of onset has been associated with phobias related to animal and natural phenomena (fear of still water/weather, closed spaces), whereas fear of flying and height- related phobias generally have an older age of onset. • Younger age of onset is also associated with an increased number of feared situations or stimuli. • Individuals with specific phobia report high lifetime rates of co-occurring disorders – particularly depressive disorders and other anxiety and fear-related disorders. In the majority of cases, specific phobia precedes the onset of other mental disorders. • Specific phobias that persist from childhood into adolescence and adulthood rarely remit spontaneously. Developmental presentations • Anxiety and fear-related disorders are the most prevalent mental disorders of childhood and adolescence. Among these conditions, specific phobia is one of the most common in young children, and may present in children as young as 3 years of age. • In children, the diagnosis of specific phobia should not be assigned when the fears are developmentally normative (e.g. fear of the dark in young children). • In preschool-aged children, phobic responses may include freezing, tantrums or crying. Duration, frequency and intensity of these reactions may be used to distinguish between age-typical fears and",
