  "text_en": "Anxiety and fear-related disorders 273 Course features • Onset of panic disorder typically occurs during the early 20s. • Some individuals experience episodic symptom outbreaks with long periods of remission, while others experience persistent, severe symptoms. • The presence of co-occurring disorders (e.g. other anxiety and fear-related disorders, depressive disorders, disorders due to substance use) has been associated with poorer long-term course trajectory. • A co-occurring diagnosis of agoraphobia is generally associated with greater symptom severity and a poorer long-term prognosis. Developmental presentations • Although some children report physical symptoms of panic attacks, panic disorder is very rare in younger children because cognitive capacity for catastrophizing about the significance of symptoms is not yet fully developed. The prevalence of panic disorder increases across adolescence and early adulthood. • Adolescents with panic disorder are at greater risk of a co-occurring depressive disorder including suicidality, as well as of disorders due to substance use. Culture-related features • The symptom presentation of panic attacks may vary across cultures, influenced by cultural attributions about their etiology. For example, individuals of Cambodian origin may emphasize panic symptoms attributed to dysregulation of khyâl, a wind-like substance in traditional Cambodian ethnophysiology (e.g. dizziness, tinnitus, neck soreness). • Several notable cultural concepts of distress are related to panic disorder; these link panic, fear or anxiety to etiological attributions regarding specific social and environmental influences. Examples include attributions related to interpersonal conflict (e.g. ataque de nervios among Latin American people), exertion or orthostasis (khyâl cap among Cambodians), and atmospheric wind (trúng gió among Vietnamese individuals). These cultural labels may be applied to symptom presentations other than panic (e.g. anger paroxysms, in the case of ataque de nervios), but they often constitute panic episodes or presentations with partial phenomenological overlap with panic attacks. • Clarifying cultural attributions and the context of the experience of symptoms can inform whether panic attacks should be considered unexpected, as must be the case in panic disorder. For example, panic attacks may involve specific foci of apprehension that are better accounted for by another disorder (e.g. social situations in social anxiety disorder).
