Boys may be more likely to be clinically referred because of greater prevalence of co-occurring attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or problematic externalizing behaviours. • Among community samples, the gender ratio of males to females ranges from 1.5:1 to 3:1. This ratio appears greater in clinical samples (estimated at 6:1). Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis) Boundary with disorders of intellectual development Individuals with disorders of intellectual development often present with limitations in academic achievement by virtue of significant generalized deficits in intellectual functioning. It is therefore difficult to establish the co-occurring presence of a developmental learning disorder in individuals with a disorder of intellectual development. Developmental learning disorder should only be diagnosed in the presence of a disorder of intellectual development when the limitations in learning are significantly in excess of those usually expected for the individual’s level of intellectual functioning. Boundary with developmental language disorder Persistent deficits in the acquisition, understanding, production or use of language in developmental language disorder may lead to academic learning difficulties, especially in literacy – including word reading and written output. If all diagnostic requirements for both developmental language disorder and developmental learning disorder are met, both diagnoses may be assigned. Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Many individuals with developmental learning disorder have marked difficulties in self-regulating attention. However, unlike in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, the limitations in acquisition of academic skills in developmental learning disorder are not solely a function of a child’s ability to sustain attention on academic tasks or modulate their activity level appropriately. The co-occurrence of developmental learning disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is common, and both disorders may be diagnosed if diagnostic requirements are met. Boundary with sensory impairments Developmental learning disorder must be differentiated from learning difficulties that arise because of sensory impairments in vision or hearing. However, individuals with vision and hearing problems for which appropriate accommodations have been made may also have co-occurring developmental learning disorder. Boundary with neurodegenerative diseases Developmental learning disorder is distinguished from learning difficulties that occur after the developmental period due to neurodegenerative diseases or to injury (e.g. traumatic brain injury) by the fact that in the latter conditions there is a loss of previously acquired academic skills and previous capacity for learning new skills.
