Catatonia | Catatonia induced by subtances or medications Catatonia 205 Course features • The onset of catatonia induced by substances or medications is typically rapid, often with fast deterioration. The duration of catatonia strongly depends on the inducing substance. Catatonia is more often induced by substance withdrawal than intoxication. Once the effects of the substance or medication (including a withdrawal syndrome) have subsided, catatonia typically remits within days. 6E69 Secondary catatonia syndrome Essential (required) features • The general diagnostic requirements for catatonia are met. • The catatonic symptoms are judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of a medical condition, based on evidence from the history, physical examination or laboratory findings. This judgement depends on establishing that: • the medical condition is known to be capable of producing the symptoms of catatonia; • the course of the catatonic symptoms (e.g. onset, remission, response of the symptoms to treatment of the etiological medical condition) is consistent with causation by the medical condition; • the symptoms are not fully accounted for by delirium, another mental disorder (e.g. schizophrenia or another primary psychotic disorder, a mood disorder or autism spectrum disorder), the effects of a medication or substance – including withdrawal effects – or a primary movement disorder classified in Chapter 8 on diseases of the nervous system (e.g. Parkinson disease, Huntington disease). • The symptoms are sufficiently severe to be a specific focus of clinical attention. Additional clinical features • Catatonia symptoms that often cluster together in critically ill adults with secondary catatonia include mutism, staring and immobility.
