Course features • Onset of adjustment disorder usually occurs within 1 month after exposure to a stressful life event (i.e. illness, marital distress). However, onset can occur after a longer delay (e.g. 3 months after exposure). • Acute and intense stressful life events (e.g. sudden job loss) typically result in a correspondingly precipitous onset of symptoms that tend to have a shorter duration, whereas more persistent stressful life events (e.g. ongoing marital distress) typically result in delayed onset of symptoms and a longer duration. • The intensity and duration of adjustment disorder varies widely. Developmental presentations • In children, the characteristic symptoms of preoccupation with a stressor or its consequences or constant rumination about the stressor are often not expressed directly but rather are manifested in somatic symptoms (e.g. stomach pains or headaches), disruptive or oppositional behaviour, hyperactivity, tantrums, concentration problems, irritability and increased clinginess. Other reactions to stressors – including regression, bedwetting and sleep disturbances – may be a manifestation of adjustment disorder if they are persistent (e.g. have been present for approximately 1 month). • In adolescents, behavioural manifestations of adjustment disorder can include substance use and various forms of acting out or risk-taking. • Because children and adolescents may not explicitly verbalize a connection between stressful events and their own symptoms and behaviours, in making the diagnosis it is important to consider the temporal relationship between the stressor and the onset of symptoms, and the extent to which they constitute a change from prior functioning. • Among older adults, preoccupation with somatic complaints is a common sign of distress related to stressors. Older adults who suffer from adjustment disorder tend to express greater anxiety about their health, report significant demoralization, and often display persistent somatization of psychological symptoms.
