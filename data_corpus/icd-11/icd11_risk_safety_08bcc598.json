Withdrawal onset may be delayed by 3–5 days with longer-acting drugs and may persist for several weeks. • Sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic withdrawal may be complicated by seizures, which are of a tonic-clonic type and may be single or multiple. • Sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic withdrawal, especially when untreated, may progress to a very severe form of delirium, characterized by confusion and disorientation, delusions, and more prolonged visual, tactile or auditory hallucinations. In such cases, a separate diagnosis of 6C44.5 Sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic-induced delirium should also be assigned. • Medical sequelae of complicated withdrawal include status epilepticus, respiratory compromise and renal failure. • Some features of sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic withdrawal – such as anxiety, transient illusions or hallucinations, and derealization – may persist for several months after cessation of use. Cocaine Presenting features of cocaine withdrawal may include depressed or dysphoric mood, irritability, fatigue, psychomotor agitation or retardation, vivid unpleasant dreams, insomnia or hypersomnia, increased appetite, anxiety and craving for cocaine. Additional features • Initial symptoms of cocaine withdrawal include a dysphoric and low energy state manifested in depressed or dysphoric mood, irritability, fatigue, inertia and hypersomnia. This typically occurs within 6–24 hours of cessation of cocaine use. • The withdrawal state may last up to 7 days. Craving for cocaine is prominent in the later stages. • Suicidal ideation may occur, especially when dysphoric mood is marked. • At the onset of cocaine withdrawal there may be features that persist from the intoxicating effects of cocaine, such as hyperactivity, paranoid ideation and auditory hallucinations. Stimulants, including Presenting features of stimulant withdrawal may include depressed or dysphoric mood, amfetamines, irritability, fatigue, insomnia or (more commonly) hypersomnia, vivid and unpleasant methamfetamine and dreams, increased appetite, psychomotor agitation or retardation, and craving for methcathinone amfetamine and related stimulants. Additional features • Stimulant withdrawal typically occurs within 24 hours to 4 days of cessation of stimulant use, and is characterized by a dysphoric and low energy state manifested in depressed or dysphoric mood, irritability, fatigue, inertia and hypersomnia. • The severity and duration of the withdrawal state is widely variable based on the type of stimulant taken and the amount, frequency and duration of such use prior to its cessation. • In the first phase of stimulant withdrawal, which typically lasts for 7–14 days, low mood, lethargy and hypersomnia predominate. After this phase, irritability and craving for stimulants are prominent and may persist for 6–8 weeks. • At the onset of stimulant withdrawal there may be features that persist from the intoxicating effects of the stimulant, such as hyperactivity, paranoid ideation and auditory hallucinations.
