If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort. Additional clinical features • Individuals with social anxiety disorder may report concerns about physical symptoms – such as blushing, sweating or trembling – rather than initially endorsing fears of negative evaluation. • Social anxiety disorder frequently co-occurs with other anxiety and fear-related disorders and depressive disorders. • Individuals with social anxiety disorder are at higher risk of developing disorders due to substance use, which may arise subsequent to use for the purposes of attenuating anxiety symptoms in social situations. • Individuals with social anxiety disorder may not view their fear or anxiety in response to social situations as excessive. As such, clinical judgement should be applied to determine whether the reported fear, anxiety or avoidance behaviour is disproportionate to what the social situation warrants, taking into consideration both accepted cultural norms and the specific environmental circumstances to which the individual is subjected (e.g. fear of interacting with peers may be appropriate if the individual is being bullied).
