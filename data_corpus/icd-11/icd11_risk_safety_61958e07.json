Additional clinical features • The impulse to set fires in individuals with pyromania may involve a careful planning phase to determine how to commit the act, with a concomitant gradual increase of tension or affective arousal; in other instances, fire setting may occur opportunistically without planning. In both cases, there is a lack of control over urges or impulses to set fires. • In individuals with pyromania, fire setting may occur in response to feelings of depressed mood, anxiety, boredom, loneliness or other negative affective states. Although not diagnostically determinative, consideration of the relationship between emotional and behavioural cues and fire-setting behaviour may be an important aspect of treatment planning. • Many individuals with pyromania exhibit impairments in social skills and a history of learning difficulties. Furthermore, individuals with pyromania – particularly women – often report histories of exposure to trauma, including sexual abuse, and self-harm. • Conduct-dissocial disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and adjustment disorder are frequently associated with fire setting. Furthermore, pyromania appears commonly to co-occur with disorders due to substance use, gambling disorder, mood disorders, impulse control disorders, and disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders.
