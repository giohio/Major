Disorders specifically associated with stress | Adjustment disorder Disorders specifically associated with stress 355 6B44 Reactive attachment disorder Essential (required) features • A history of grossly insufficient care is required for diagnosis, which may include: • persistent disregard for the child’s basic emotional needs for comfort, stimulation and affection; • persistent disregard for the child’s basic physical needs; • repeated changes of primary caregivers (e.g. frequent changes in foster-care providers); • rearing in unusual settings (e.g. institutions) that prevent formation of stable selective attachments; • maltreatment. • Markedly abnormal attachment behaviours towards adult caregivers in a child are characterized by a persistent and pervasive pattern of inhibited, emotionally withdrawn behaviour including both of the following: • minimal seeking of comfort when distressed; • rare or minimal response to comfort when it is offered. • The grossly insufficient care is presumed to be responsible for the persistent and pervasive pattern of inhibited, emotionally withdrawn behaviour. • The symptoms are evident before the age of 5 years. • The child has reached a developmental level by which the capacity to form selective attachments with caregivers normally develops, which typically occurs at a chronological age of 1 year or a developmental age of at least 9 months. • The abnormal attachment behaviours are not better accounted for by autism spectrum disorder. • The abnormal attachment behaviours are not confined to a specific dyadic relationship. Additional clinical features • Persistent disregard for the child’s basic needs may meet the definition for neglect: egregious acts or omissions by a caregiver that deprive a child of needed age-appropriate care and that result, or have reasonable potential to result, in physical or psychological harm. Reactive attachment disorder is associated with persistent neglect rather than isolated incidents. • Reactive attachment disorder may also be associated with persistent maltreatment, characterized by one or more of the following: • non-accidental acts of physical force that result – or have reasonable potential to result – in physical harm, or that evoke significant fear; • sexual acts involving a child that are intended to provide sexual gratification to an adult; • non-accidental verbal or symbolic acts that result in significant psychological harm.
