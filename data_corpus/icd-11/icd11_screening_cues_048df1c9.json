Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis) Boundary with panic disorder Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent, unexpected, self-limited episodes of intense fear or anxiety. Generalized anxiety disorder is differentiated by a more persistent and less circumscribed chronic feeling of apprehensiveness, usually associated with worry about a variety of different everyday life events. Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder may experience panic attacks that are triggered by specific worries. If an individual with generalized anxiety disorder experiences panic attacks exclusively in the context of the worry about a variety of everyday life events, or general apprehensiveness without the presence of unexpected panic attacks, an additional diagnosis of panic disorder is not warranted and the presence of panic attacks may be indicated using the with panic attacks specifier. However, if unexpected panic attacks also occur, an additional diagnosis of panic disorder may be assigned. Boundary with social anxiety disorder In social anxiety disorder, symptoms occur in response to feared social situations (e.g. speaking in public, initiating a conversation), and the primary focus of apprehension is being negatively evaluated by others. Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder may worry about the implications of performing poorly or failing an examination but are not exclusively concerned about being negatively evaluated by others.
