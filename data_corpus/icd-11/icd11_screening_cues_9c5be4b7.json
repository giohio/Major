As previously indicated, the CDDR are not intended to function as a manual for conducting clinical assessments. Rather, they are to be applied in the context of clinicians’ broader understanding of the disorders they are assessing and the clinical competencies they have gained through appropriate education, training and experience. This chapter also contains information on relevant aspects of diagnostic coding, some of which are the result of important innovations in how ICD-11 categories are represented and relate to one another. This material on coding relates to the entire ICD-11 and is not specific to the chapter on mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders. Coding is discussed here as it affects the implementation of the CDDR. This chapter includes a discussion of the following issues: • components of the CDDR; • making an ICD-11 diagnosis using the CDDR; • co-occurring and mutually exclusive diagnoses; • other specified and unspecified categories; • other ICD-11 chapters relevant to diagnostic formulation of mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders; and • ICD-11 diagnostic coding. Components of the CDDR A major improvement in the ICD-11 CDDR compared to the ICD-10 CDDG is the consistency of structure and information across major categories. The information provided for the main disorder categories in the CDDR is organized under the following headings: • Essential (required) features • Additional clinical features • Boundary with normality (threshold) • Course features • Developmental presentations • Culture-related features • Sex- and/or gender-related features • Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis). The information provided is based on reviews of the available evidence, and is intended to be useful in making diagnostic judgements about individual patients. These sections do not provide a summary of all available information about the topic in question, but rather focus on issues that may be specifically relevant to assigning a diagnosis to an individual patient. If a particular heading (e.g. developmental presentations, sex- and/or gender-related information) is not provided for a specific disorder, this is because insufficient evidence was identified as a basis for making clinically 22 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders relevant and broadly applicable statements.
