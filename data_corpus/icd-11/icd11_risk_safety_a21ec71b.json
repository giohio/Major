  "text_en": "Neurocognitive disorders 603 • Delirium may be caused by the direct physiological effects of a medical condition not classified under mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders, by the direct physiological effects of a substance or medication – including withdrawal – or by multiple or unknown etiological factors. • The symptoms are not better accounted for by a pre-existing or evolving neurocognitive disorder (e.g. amnestic disorder, mild neurocognitive disorder, dementia) or by another mental disorder (e.g. schizophrenia or another primary psychotic disorder, a mood disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, a dissociative disorder). • When a substance or medication is present, the symptoms are in excess of those typical of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal for that substance, although delirium can occur as a complication of intoxication or withdrawal states (see 6D70.1 Delirium due to psychoactive substances, including medications, below). Additional clinical features • In delirium, cognition is typically impaired in a global manner, such that multiple areas of neurocognitive functioning are impaired upon assessment. • Delirium may include impaired perception, which can manifest as illusions (i.e. misinterpretations of sensory inputs), delusions or hallucinations. • Delirium often includes disturbance of emotion, including anxiety symptoms, depressed mood, irritability, fear, anger, euphoria or apathy. • Behavioural symptoms may be present (e.g. agitation, restlessness, impulsivity). A disturbance of the sleep-wake cycle, including reduced arousal of acute onset or total sleep loss followed by reversal of the sleep-wake cycle, may also be present. • The presence of a pre-existing neurocognitive disorder can increase the risk of delirium and complicate its course. Boundary with normality (threshold) • Normal ageing is typically associated with some degree of cognitive change. Delirium is differentiated from age-related cognitive changes by the sudden onset of symptoms (e.g. within hours or days), the presence of significant confusion and/or global neurocognitive impairment, and the transient and typically fluctuating symptom presentation. Course features • Onset of symptoms is typically sudden (e.g. within hours or days), with a transient and/or fluctuating course. • Symptoms are generally expected to remit with treatment",
