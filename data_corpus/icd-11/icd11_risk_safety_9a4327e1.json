If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort. Additional clinical features • In children, it may be appropriate to assign the diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder after a somewhat briefer period of initial symptoms (e.g. 1 year). Mood disorders | Cyclothymic disorder Mood disorders 241 • Individuals initially diagnosed with cyclothymic disorder are at high risk of developing bipolar type I or bipolar type II disorder during their lifetime. • Individuals with cyclothymic disorder do not typically exhibit psychotic symptoms. Boundary with normality (threshold) • Cyclothymic disorder is distinguished from normal variations in mood by a history of distress or difficulty functioning due to repeated occurrences of mood disturbance. Course features • The course of cyclothymic disorder is often gradual and persistent. Onset of cyclothymic disorder commonly occurs during adolescence or early adulthood, and may be difficult to differentiate from normal mood instability associated with hormonal changes that accompany puberty. Developmental presentations • Onset of cyclothymic disorder in children typically occurs before the age of 10 years. Symptoms of irritability (particularly during periods of low mood) and sleep disturbance are often the prominent clinical features and reasons for consultation. • Cyclothymic disorder is underdiagnosed in children and adolescents despite evidence for greater prevalence of this disorder in this age group compared to bipolar type I and bipolar type II disorders. However, the most common trajectory in children and adolescents is symptom remission; only a minority will maintain the diagnosis into adulthood or be at high risk of developing bipolar type I or bipolar type II disorder. • Co-occurrence of other mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders is common among children and adolescents with cyclothymic disorder – particularly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
