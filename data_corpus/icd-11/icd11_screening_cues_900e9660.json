Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Substance withdrawal 488 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders Substance-induced mental disorders Substance-induced mental disorders are characterized by psychological, cognitive or behavioural symptoms that develop during or soon after psychoactive substance intoxication or withdrawal, or use or discontinuation of a psychoactive medication. The duration or severity of the symptoms is substantially in excess of the characteristic syndrome of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal due to the specified substance. Substance-induced mental disorders include: Substance-induced delirium Substance-induced psychotic disorder • with hallucinations • with delusions • with mixed psychotic symptoms Substance-induced mood disorder • with depressive symptoms • with manic symptoms • with mixed depressive and manic symptoms Substance-induced anxiety disorder Substance-induced obsessive-compulsive or related disorder Substance-induced impulse control disorder. Specific types of substance-induced mental disorders are only applicable for some substance classes, which are listed along with corresponding codes in the sections on specific substance- induced mental disorders below, as well as in Table 6.14 (p. 454). Specific substance-induced mental disorders may characteristically have their onset during or soon after substance intoxication and/ or substance withdrawal for specific substances or substance classes. When making a diagnosis of substance-induced mental disorder, an additional diagnosis indicating the related pattern of substance use should also be assigned. These include episode of harmful psychoactive substance use, harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use and substance dependence. A diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal may also be assigned if applicable. Additional categories of substance-induced disorders are included in other groupings of this chapter on mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders, and CDDR are provided in the corresponding sections. These categories are cross-listed in this section for reference, and include: 6A41 Catatonia induced by substances or medications (p. 204). 6D70.1 Delirium due to psychoactive substances, including medications (p. 606). 6D72.1 Amnestic disorder due to psychoactive substances, including medications (p. 616). 6D84 Dementia due to psychoactive substances, including medications (p. 626). Essential features for each substance-induced mental disorder category are provided below, as are any specifiers corresponding to specific disorders. Other CDDR elements – additional clinical features, boundary with normality (threshold) and boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis) – apply to all substance-induced mental disorder categories and are provided at the end of this section.
