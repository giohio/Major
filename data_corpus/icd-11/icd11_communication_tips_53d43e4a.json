However, when the rate of speech increases, even familiar listeners may not be able to understand the individual. • Developmental speech sound disorder may be associated with imprecision and inconsistency of oral movements required for speech, especially in young children (also called childhood apraxia or dyspraxia of speech), resulting in difficulty producing sequences of speech sounds, specific consonants and vowels, and appropriate prosody (intonation and rhythm of speech). There may be some associated oral-motor dysfunction affecting early feeding, sucking and chewing, blowing, and imitating oral movements and speech sounds, but not with the weakness, slowness or incoordination found in dysarthria. • Developmental speech sound disorder commonly co-occurs with other neurodevelopmental disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, developmental speech fluency disorder and developmental language disorder. Boundary with normality (threshold) • Children vary widely in the sequence and age at which they acquire speech sounds. Such normal variation does not reflect the presence of developmental speech sound disorder. In contrast, children with developmental speech sound disorder exhibit persistent problems that cause significant limitations in the ability to communicate due to reduced intelligibility of speech. Up until the age of 4 years, various speech sound errors are common among children with typically developing speech sound acquisition, but communication remains relatively intact despite these errors, relative to same-aged peers. Course features • Many young children with developmental speech sound disorder experience remission by school age. Among young children diagnosed in early childhood, up to 50–70% will exhibit academic difficulties throughout their schooling, even if the speech sound difficulties themselves have remitted. • Compared to children and adolescents with a sole diagnosis of developmental speech sound disorder, those with a co-occurring developmental language disorder are more likely to develop other mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders such as anxiety and fear-related disorders or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. They are also more likely to exhibit greater difficulties academically, socially and adaptively by late childhood and adolescence.
