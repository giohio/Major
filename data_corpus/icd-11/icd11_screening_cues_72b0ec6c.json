Additional clinical features • In some individuals, the affective component of a depressive episode may be primarily experienced and expressed as irritability, or as an absence of emotional experience (e.g. “emptiness”). These variants in the expression of the affective component can be considered as meeting the depressed mood requirement for a depressive episode if they represent a significant change from the individual’s typical functioning. • In some individuals – particularly those experiencing a severe depressive episode – there may be reluctance to describe certain experiences (e.g. psychotic symptoms) or inability to do so in detail (e.g. due to psychomotor agitation or retardation). In such cases, observations made by the clinician or reported by a collateral informant are important in determining the diagnostic status and severity of the episode. • Depressive episodes may be associated with increased consumption of alcohol or other substances, exacerbation of pre-existing psychological symptoms (e.g. phobic or obsessional symptoms) or somatic preoccupations. Boundary with normality (threshold) • Some depression of mood is a normal reaction to severe adverse life events and problems (e.g. divorce, job loss), and is common in the community. A depressive episode is differentiated from this common experience by the severity, range and duration of symptoms. If the diagnostic requirements for a depressive episode listed above are met, a depressive episode should still be considered present, even if there are identifiable life events that appear to have triggered the episode.
