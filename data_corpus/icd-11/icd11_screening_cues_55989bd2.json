  "text_en": "192 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders Note that the mild, moderate and severe ratings for the depressive mood symptoms specifier are not equivalent to the corresponding diagnostic requirements for a mild, moderate or severe depressive episode. In other words, a rating of mild for depressive mood symptoms in the psychotic disorder specifiers does not indicate that the individual meets the requirements for a mild depressive episode. The same is true of the manic mood symptoms specifier. The rating of depressive and manic mood symptoms in these specifiers indicates the severity of depressed, elevated, or irritable mood, and does not include other symptoms (e.g. disrupted sleep, anhedonia, appetite change) that can occur as a part of mood episodes. Symptom specifier ratings are intended to characterize the current clinical presentation among individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, and should not be used in individuals without such a diagnosis. Symptoms attributable to the direct pathophysiological consequences of a comorbid medical condition or injury not classified under mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. a brain tumour or traumatic brain injury), or to the direct physiological effects of substances or medications (including withdrawal effects), should not be included in the specifier ratings. However, in individuals with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, the specific etiology of symptoms is often unclear (e.g. whether a mood symptom is due to the psychotic disorder or a result of substance use). In these cases, the relevant symptom should be considered in making the specifier rating until it becomes clear that the pathogenesis of the symptom is unrelated to the primary psychotic disorder.

Everyday functioning is not affected by these symptoms, or is affected only minimally. No significant negative social or personal consequences have occurred as a consequence of the symptoms. The symptoms may be intermittent and show fluctuations in severity, and there may be periods during which the symptoms are absent. Compared to other individuals with similar symptoms, the severity of symptoms in the domain is in the mildest third. Moderate A greater number of symptoms in the domain have been present during the XS0T past week, or a smaller number of symptoms that have a substantial degree of impact. Everyday functioning may be moderately affected by the symptoms. There are negative social or personal consequences of the symptoms, but these are not severe.
