  "text_en": "490 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders Essential (required) features • The presentation is characterized by psychotic symptoms (e.g. delusions, hallucinations or disorganized thinking or behaviour) that develop during or soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from a specified substance, or use or discontinuation of a psychoactive medication. • The intensity or duration of the psychotic symptoms is substantially in excess of psychotic- like disturbances of perception, cognition or behaviour that are characteristic of intoxication or withdrawal due to the specified substance. • The specified substance, as well as the amount and duration of its use, is known to be capable of producing psychotic symptoms (see the list above and Table 6.14, p. 454). • The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder such as schizophrenia or a mood disorder with psychotic symptoms. Evidence supporting a diagnosis of another mental disorder would include psychotic symptoms preceding the onset of the substance use, the symptoms persisting for a substantial period of time after cessation of the substance, or medication use or withdrawal (e.g. 1 month or more depending on the specific substance), or other evidence of a pre-existing mental disorder with psychotic symptoms (e.g. a history of prior episodes not associated with substance use). • The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition. • The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Specifiers for substance-induced psychotic symptoms An additional specifier can be added to denote the presence of hallucinations, delusions, or mixed psychotic symptoms for alcohol-induced psychotic disorder (6C40.6), cocaine-induced psychotic disorder (6C45.6), stimulant-induced psychotic disorder, including amfetamines, methamfetamine or methcathinone (6C46.6), and synthetic cathinone-induced psychotic disorder (6C47.6). The x below corresponds to the fourth-character code indicating the substance class (0 for alcohol, 1 for cannabis and so on) (see the list above and Table 6.14, p. 454).",
