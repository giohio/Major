  "text_en": "ICD-11 CDDR compared to the ICD-10 CDDG (16) was designed to make the CDDR more useful in clinical decision-making, and therefore also in education and training. The extremely high ratings of the clinical utility of the CDDR, particularly in international clinic-based field studies with real patients (19,48) suggest that this objective was achieved. Moreover, the solid reliability results from the ICD-11 field studies (18,48) indicate that the CDDR would be satisfactory for use in certain kinds of research projects – for example, projects focused on individuals with particular diagnoses as these are assigned in health-care settings (e.g. patients diagnosed with recurrent depressive disorder receiving services at a particular facility). However, in other types of research projects, in which obtaining reproducible and precise psychiatric diagnoses is more important, standardized diagnostic assessment procedures are necessary. This is meant to control variability inherent in diagnostic processes that rely on the interviewer’s diagnostic interviewing skills (different interviewers may ask different questions to assess the same clinical phenomena) and clinical judgement (different interviewers may arrive at different diagnostic conclusions). For example, studies of the efficacy of treatments for particular disorders require consistency in diagnostic procedures to ensure that the population being studied has been assigned the diagnosis for which the treatment is intended according to consistent and explicit diagnostic rules to reduce random diagnostic heterogeneity. Similarly, epidemiological studies that utilize lay (i.e. not clinically trained) interviewers to apply the ICD-11 CDDR require pre-scripted questions and strict decision rules because they cannot rely on the clinical expertise of the interviewer to make judgements about which features are present. For these reasons, several WHO-sponsored diagnostic instruments are being developed to facilitate the application of the ICD-11 CDDR in particular research settings. The Structured Clinical Interview for ICD-11 (SCII-11) is a semi-structured diagnostic interview that requires experience in clinical interviewing on the part of the interviewer. The SCII-11 is designed to be used in conjunction with the CDDR, and provides a standardized set of questions to assist researchers to elicit the information needed to conduct a differential diagnosis in the context of research studies. It will also be useful for training purposes and in clinical settings. The development of the SCII-11 required extensive decisions about operationalizing the CDDR so that they can be more reliably applied in research settings. The SCII-11 operationalized the CDDR in two different ways: by substituting more precise diagnostic thresholds and by the choice of wording of corresponding interview questions. The CDDR intentionally avoid artificially precise duration and symptom cutoffs, allowing clinicians more flexibility for clinical judgement. The SCII-11 modifies some of the CDDR items, substituting more precise thresholds. For example, the ICD-11 CDDR for panic disorder define a panic attack as follows: “Panic attacks are discrete episodes of intense fear or apprehension also characterized by the rapid and concurrent onset of several characteristic symptoms. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, the following…” The SCII-11 has modified this item, substituting the word “several” with “at least three”. Similarly, the CDDR incorporate many broadly defined diagnostic constructs that could be assessed in different ways. Rather than relying on the interviewer to decide the best way to assess them, the SCII-11 operationalizes diagnostic constructs through the specificity and wording of corresponding interview questions. For example, the CDDR for schizophrenia require the presence of at least two items from a list of seven, most of the time for a period of 1 month, with one of the seven being “persistent delusions (e.g. grandiose delusions, delusions of reference, persecutory delusions)”. Since there is no single question that can satisfactorily cover every type of delusion, the SCII-11 divides the assessment of delusions into separate questions corresponding to specific types of delusions (e.g. delusions of reference, persecutory delusions,",
