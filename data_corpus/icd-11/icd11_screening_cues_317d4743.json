Common forms of delusions include persecutory, somatic (e.g. a belief that organs are rotting or malfunctioning despite normal medical examination), grandiose (e.g. a belief that one has discovered an elixir that gives eternal life), jealous (e.g. the unjustified belief that one’s spouse is unfaithful) and erotomanic (i.e. the belief that another person, usually a famous or high-status stranger, is in love with the person experiencing the delusion). • Absence of clear and persistent hallucinations; severely disorganized thinking (formal thought disorder); experiences of influence, passivity or control; or negative symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia is evident. However, in some cases, specific hallucinations typically related to the content of the delusions may be present (e.g. tactile hallucinations in delusions of being infected by parasites or insects). • Apart from the actions and attitudes directly related to the delusional system, affect, speech and behaviour are typically unaffected. • The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. a brain tumour), are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (e.g. corticosteroids) – including withdrawal effects (e.g. from alcohol) – and are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. another primary psychotic disorder, a mood disorder, an obsessive-compulsive or related disorder, an eating disorder). Course specifiers for delusional disorder The following specifiers should be applied to identify whether the individual currently meets the diagnostic requirements of delusional disorder or is in partial or full remission. 6A24.0 Delusional disorder, currently symptomatic • All diagnostic requirements for delusional disorder in terms of symptoms and duration are currently met, or have been met within the past month.
