Paraphilic disorders | Frotteuristic disorder 584 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders Course features • Individuals with frotteuristic disorder often report the onset of frotteuristic sexual interest during adolescence. • Frotteuristic disorder is relatively stable after young adulthood, but sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges and behaviours may change over time, such that an individual who was assigned a diagnosis of frotteuristic disorder no longer meets the diagnostic requirements. Developmental presentations • Advancing age may be associated with decreasing paraphilic sexual arousal and decreasing behavioural manifestations of frotteuristic disorder due to increased impulse control and decreased sexual drive. Sex- and/or gender-related features • Frotteuristic disorder is much more prevalent among men. Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis) Boundary with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder Both frotteuristic disorder and compulsive sexual behaviour disorder may involve repetitive sexual impulses, urges or behaviours that result in marked distress or impairment. Frotteuristic disorder is characterized by sexual impulses, urges or behaviours that are manifestations of a sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal that involves touching or rubbing against a non-consenting person. In contrast, compulsive sexual behaviour disorder is characterized by a persistent pattern of failure to control sexual impulses, urges or behaviours, regardless of the focus of sexual arousal. If an individual with frotteuristic disorder is able to exercise some degree of control over the behavioural expressions of the arousal pattern, an additional diagnosis of compulsive sexual behavioural disorder is generally not warranted. Boundary with disorders due to substance use Episodes of impulsive or disinhibited sexual behaviour, including frotteuristic behaviour, may occur during substance intoxication. Such episodes may not be a manifestation of a sustained, focused and intense sexual arousal pattern.
