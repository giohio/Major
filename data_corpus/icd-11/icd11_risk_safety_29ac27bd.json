General cultural considerations for relationship distress and maltreatment by spouse or partner • Presentations of relationship distress vary, depending on cultural constraints on their expression. In some cultures, women may be more attentive to relationship problems and therefore more likely report relationship distress. • The prevalence of the different forms of spouse or partner maltreatment (e.g. physical, sexual, psychological) vary widely by country, based on the social acceptance, detection and consequences of abusive behaviours. General sex- and/or gender-related features for relationship distress and maltreatment by spouse or partner • Although men and women are both affected by relationship distress, women’s health may be more influenced by relationship distress, whereas men’s health may be more influenced by relationship status (i.e. being in an intimate partner relationship or not). • Gender differences are country- and culture-specific. Overall, women are at much higher risk of victimization by maltreatment by their spouses or intimate partners.
