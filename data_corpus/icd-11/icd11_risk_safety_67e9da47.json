In addition, the eating of non-nutritive substances is a culturally sanctioned practice among certain groups. A diagnosis of pica should only be assigned to such behaviour if it is persistent or potentially dangerous enough to require specific clinical attention. Course features • Pica can be episodic and variable, or chronic and continuous. When variable, consumption of non-nutritive substances may be associated with increased levels of stress or anxiety. Developmental presentations • Onset of pica can occur across the lifespan, but is most commonly observed in childhood. Culture-related features • In some cases, eating of non-nutritive substances may be a culturally sanctioned practice. In these cases, consumption of the non-nutritive substance is thought to have some health, spiritual or social benefit. In parts of Africa and certain rural areas of the United States and India, for example, the eating of clay or earth (geophagia) can be a culturally accepted practice. Pica should not be diagnosed in such cases unless the quantities ingested are large enough to require clinical attention. Sex- and/or gender-related features • The prevalence of pica is similar among males and females. • Although females can be diagnosed with pica during pregnancy and the postpartum period, a diagnosis should only be assigned if consumption of non-nutritive substances is persistent or potentially dangerous enough to require specific clinical attention.
