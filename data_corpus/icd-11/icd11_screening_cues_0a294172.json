General diagnostic requirements for amnestic disorder Essential (required) features • Prominent memory impairment relative to expectations for age and general level of premorbid neurocognitive functioning, in the absence of other significant neurocognitive impairment, is required for diagnosis. • The memory impairment represents a marked decline from previous levels of functioning. • The memory impairment is characterized by reduced ability to acquire, learn and/or retain new information. • Evidence of memory impairment is based on: • information obtained from the individual, an informant or clinical observation; • substantial impairment in memory performance as demonstrated by standardized neuropsychological/cognitive testing or, in its absence, another quantified clinical assessment. • The symptoms are not better accounted for by disturbance of consciousness, altered mental status, transient global amnesia (i.e. memory impairment lasting no more than 48 hours, with most cases resolving within 6 hours), delirium, dementia, substance intoxication, substance withdrawal or another mental disorder (e.g. schizophrenia or another primary psychotic disorder, a mood disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, a dissociative disorder). • The symptoms result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. In mild cases, if functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort (e.g. compensatory strategies).
