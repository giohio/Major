Common substance-specific features of substance withdrawal Substance Substance-specific features of withdrawal Alcohol Presenting features of alcohol withdrawal may include autonomic hyperactivity (e.g. tachycardia, hypertension, perspiration), increased hand tremor, nausea, retching or vomiting, insomnia, anxiety, psychomotor agitation, depressed or dysphoric mood, transient visual, tactile or auditory illusions or hallucinations, and distractibility. Less commonly, alcohol withdrawal is complicated by seizures. Additional features • Onset of alcohol withdrawal typically occurs within 6–12 hours after last use, as blood alcohol concentrations decline. Symptoms vary in type, severity, onset and duration, according to the duration and intensity of alcohol use prior to cessation or reduction of use. • Features of mild or moderate withdrawal typically last for 3–7 days after cessation of alcohol use, and include autonomic hyperactivity, increased hand tremor, anxiety, insomnia, nausea, vomiting and headache. Features of moderate withdrawal may also include transient visual, tactile or auditory illusions or hallucinations, distractibility and psychomotor agitation. • In 1–3% of cases, alcohol withdrawal is complicated by seizures of a tonic-clonic type. When seizures occur, they are usually single seizures with onset within 6–48 hours after last use. Evidence of a premorbid seizure disorder, other intracranial pathology or co-occurring use of other substances does not preclude a presumptive alcohol withdrawal diagnosis. • Approximately 2% of cases of alcohol withdrawal progress to a very severe syndrome sometimes referred to as “delirium tremens” (or DTs), characterized by confusion and disorientation, delusions and prolonged visual, tactile or auditory hallucinations. When delirium is present, a separate diagnosis of 6C40.5 Alcohol-induced delirium should also be assigned. The presence of seizures during withdrawal represents a risk factor for development of delirium. If unrecognized or untreated, delirium during alcohol withdrawal is associated with substantially increased mortality compared to alcohol withdrawal without co-occurring delirium. • Some symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal – such as autonomic hyperactivity, anxiety and insomnia – can recur or persist for several months after abstinence, particularly when the person is exposed to alcohol-associated cues (a conditioned withdrawal state). The presence of such persisting symptoms is not sufficient to meet diagnostic requirements for alcohol withdrawal. Cannabis Presenting features of cannabis withdrawal may include irritability, anger or aggressive behaviour, shakiness, insomnia, restlessness, anxiety, depressed or dysphoric mood, decreased appetite and weight loss, headache, sweating or chills, abdominal cramps and muscle aches. Additional features • The occurrence, severity and duration of cannabis withdrawal vary according to the type and potency of the cannabis preparation, as well as the amount, frequency and duration of use before cessation or reduction of use. • Onset of cannabis withdrawal typically occurs at some point between 12 hours and 3 days after cessation or reduction of use. Symptom severity typically peaks at 4–7",
