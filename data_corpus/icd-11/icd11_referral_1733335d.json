The WHO Department of Mental Health and Substance Use operationalized the clinical utility Introduction 5 of a category in the ICD-11 chapter on mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders as depending on: • its value in communicating (e.g. among practitioners, patients, families, administrators); • its implementation characteristics in clinical practice, including its goodness of fit (i.e. accuracy of description), its ease of use and the time required to use it (i.e. feasibility); • and its usefulness in selecting interventions and in making clinical management decisions. Global applicability was addressed via the diverse global membership of the working groups and by the international nature of the field studies implemented as part of the development of the CDDR, and by specific attention to culture as a part of the CDDR (see the sections on public review and field testing and on cultural factors below). In order to generate relatively uniform information and a consistent structure across groupings and categories of the CDDR (see the next section on using the ICD-11 classification of mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders in clinical settings), working groups collated diagnostic information using a standardized template (referred to as a “content form”), with relevant references. This information served as source material for the development of the CDDR, with the final editorial responsibility vested in the WHO Department of Mental Health and Substance Use. The brief descriptions in the MMS and the more detailed essential features in the CDDR were developed together in order to be fully compatible, though designed for different purposes. The MMS brief descriptions are typically summaries of the essential features for the corresponding entity in the CDDR, although these brief descriptions alone do not provide sufficient information for implementation in clinical settings. Public review and field testing Proposals developed by working groups were described in the scientific literature (e.g. 20–26), made available for public review (27), and tested via a systematic programme of global field studies (see the section on field studies below). Scientific oversight for the field studies was provided by the ICD-11 Field Studies Coordination Group (FSCG) (28), comprising global leaders in clinical care, scientific research and public health representing all WHO regions, with substantial representation from low- and middle-income countries. FSCG members not only lent their technical expertise to the design, analysis and interpretation of the field studies but also served as essential facilitators by successfully engaging global clinicians to participate in ICD-11 field studies around the world. Many of them directed international field study centres, which conducted field studies in routine clinical settings with real patients. The FSCG and relevant working groups were also involved in proposing changes to the CDDR based on the results of the field studies (17). WHO’s comprehensive programme of field testing to assess the reliability, clinical utility and global applicability of the proposed CDDR was a major area of innovation, employing novel study designs and new methodologies for collecting information. Global participation was a defining characteristic of the ICD-11 CDDR field studies, which engaged multidisciplinary clinicians working in diverse contexts across the world, and were conducted in multiple languages. A key strength of the research programme was that studies were conducted within a time frame that allowed the results to be used as a basis for further revision of the CDDR prior to publication. Early in the revision process, two major international, multilingual surveys were conducted – one of psychiatrists, conducted in collaboration with the World Psychiatric Association (29) and the other of psychologists, conducted in collaboration with the International Union of Psychological Science (30). These surveys focused on participants’ use of diagnostic classification systems in clinical practice, and the desirable characteristics of a classification of mental disorders.
