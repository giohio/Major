This involves first considering whether any of the medications being used to treat the medical condition are known to cause psychotic symptoms at the dose and duration at which it has been administered. Second, a temporal relationship between the medication use and the onset of the psychotic symptoms should be established (i.e. the psychotic symptoms began after administration of the medication and/or remitted once the medication was discontinued). The same reasoning applies to individuals with a medical condition and psychotic symptoms who are also using a psychoactive substance known to cause hallucinations or delusions, in the context of either intoxication or withdrawal (e.g. visual hallucinations during sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic withdrawal; paranoid delusions during cocaine intoxication).
