Boundary with normality (threshold) • Many situations involving separation are associated with other potential stressors or are normal sources of anxiety (e.g. leaving home to start a job or attend university in a new city). Separation anxiety disorder is differentiated based on the focus of apprehension being on separation from a key attachment figure rather than on other aspects of adjusting to novel circumstances. • Strong attachment to loved ones is a normal and healthy part of life, and separation from these individuals may be associated with transient sadness or anxiety. Preschool-aged children may show a moderate or even greater degree of anxiety over real or threatened separation from people to whom they are attached. These reactions are considered developmentally appropriate, and are differentiated from separation anxiety disorder on the basis of the persistence of the symptoms (e.g. lasting for several months) with repeated separations, evidence of excessive preoccupations about the well-being of attachment figures, persistent avoidance, and significant distress or impairment in functioning as a consequence of the symptoms. • Among children and adolescents, school refusal is a common occurrence, and may be based on transient anxiety about separation from a loved one or be symptomatic of separation anxiety disorder. However, especially in adolescence, anxiety about school or school refusal is not typically related to fear of separation but rather to other factors such as truancy, peer rejection or bullying. Course features • The typical onset of separation anxiety disorder is during childhood, and the disorder can persist into adulthood. Initial disorder onset during adolescence and adulthood may be less common. • Separation anxiety disorder has been associated with elevated risk of developing a wide range of internalizing disorders, including depressive disorders, bipolar disorders and anxiety and fear-related disorders. There is also evidence of elevated risk of disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
