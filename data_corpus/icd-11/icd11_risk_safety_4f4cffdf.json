Furthermore, problems of affect regulation may manifest as dissociation, suppression of emotional experience and expression, and avoidance of situations or experiences that may elicit emotions, including positive emotions. • In adolescence, substance use, risk-taking behaviours (e.g. unsafe sex, unsafe driving, non- suicidal self-harm) and aggressive behaviours may be particularly evident as expressions of problems of affect dysregulation and interpersonal difficulties. • When parents or caregivers are the source of the trauma (e.g. sexual abuse), children and adolescents often develop a disorganized attachment style that can manifest as unpredictable behaviours towards these individuals (e.g. alternating between neediness, rejection and aggression). In children under 5 years of age, attachment disturbances related to maltreatment may also include reactive attachment disorder or disinhibited social engagement disorder, which can co-occur with complex post-traumatic stress disorder. • Children and adolescents with complex post-traumatic stress disorder often report symptoms consistent with depressive disorders, eating and feeding disorders, sleep- wake disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct-dissocial disorder and separation anxiety disorder. The relationship of traumatic experiences to the onset of symptoms can be useful in establishing a differential diagnosis. At the same time, other mental disorders can also develop following extremely stressful or traumatic experiences. Additional co-occurring diagnoses should only be made if the symptoms are not fully accounted for by complex post-traumatic stress disorder, and all diagnostic requirements for each disorder are met. • In older adults, complex post-traumatic stress disorder may be dominated by anxious avoidance of thoughts, feelings, memories and people, as well as physiological symptoms of anxiety (e.g. enhanced startle reaction, autonomic hyper-reactivity). Affected individuals may experience intense regret related to the impact of traumatic experiences on their lives. Culture-related features • Cultural variation exists in the expression of symptoms of complex post-traumatic stress disorder.
