Respondents described a number of categories as having poor clinical utility in practice, while others were recommended for addition or deletion (31,32). These data were used in the initial decisions about the content of the CDDR and in the development of diagnostic guidance by working groups. In order to provide data to assist in developing an organizational structure that would be more clinically useful, two formative field studies were conducted to examine the conceptualizations held by mental health professionals around the world regarding the structure of mental disorders and the relationships among them (33,34). These data showed a high degree of similarity across countries, languages and regions, regardless of the classification system participants used in clinical practice, and informed decisions about the structure of the classification. The proposed CDDR material was then tested in two main sets of evaluative field studies: case-controlled (internet-based) and ecological implementation (clinic-based) field studies. The case-controlled studies assessed the clinical utility of the proposed diagnostic material; most compared how global clinicians applied the proposed ICD-11 material versus the ICD-10 diagnostic guidelines for a given diagnostic area in terms of accuracy and consistency of clinicians’ diagnostic formulations, using a scientifically rigorous vignette-based methodology (17,35). Other studies examined scaling for diagnostic specifiers (36) and how clinicians actually used classifications in their clinical practice (37), including how they combined multiple dimensions in making a categorical diagnosis (38). Case-controlled studies were conducted in between three and six languages – Chinese, English, French, Japanese, Spanish and Russian – per study, with participation from thousands of clinicians from across the globe who were members of WHO’s Global Clinical Practice Network. The Network’s field studies have assessed a wide range of disorder groupings (e.g. 39–45). Two internet-based studies comparing ICD-11 to ICD-10 were also conducted in German (46,47). Overall, these studies have demonstrated incrementally superior – or in some cases equivalent – performance of the ICD-11 CDDR compared to the ICD-10 CDDG in the accuracy of diagnoses assigned to case vignettes by participating clinicians, as well as improvements in ratings of clinical utility. When a clinician’s diagnoses did not follow the expected pattern, the study methodology allowed for examination of which specific features of the diagnostic requirements accounted for underperformance, which in turn permitted modifications to the CDDR to address points of ambiguity or misunderstanding (e.g. 39,44). These studies also included analyses of results by region and language to identify potential difficulties in global or cultural applicability, as well as problems in translation. In addition to refining the CDDR, data from these studies have provided useful information for the development of training programmes on the new ICD-11 diagnostic material. For example, the German study examining performance on a coding task suggested a substantial need for training initiatives to support the use of ICD-11 by professional coders (47). Two major ecological implementation (clinic-based) field studies were conducted. The first tested the proposed CDDR diagnostic material when applied by practising clinicians to adult patients receiving care in the types of clinical settings in which the CDDR will be implemented (18,19). The study was conducted in 14 countries – Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt, India, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, Mexico, Nigeria, the Russian Federation, South Africa, Spain and Tunisia – via a network of international field study centres. The study assessed the reliability and clinical utility of the CDDR for disorders that account for the highest percentage of global disease burden and use of mental health services in clinical settings among adults: schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, mood disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders, and disorders specifically associated with stress.
