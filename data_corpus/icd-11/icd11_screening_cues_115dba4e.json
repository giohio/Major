The lack of insight exhibited by the individual does not vary markedly as a function of anxiety level. 6B22.Z Olfactory reference disorder, unspecified Additional clinical features • The diagnosis of olfactory reference disorder partly depends on determining whether there is evidence of the odour reported by the individual. A variety of other medical and dental conditions can be associated with unpleasant odours (e.g. periodontal disease, trimethylaminuria), and these underlying causes should be ruled out, particularly if the odour is detectable even if slight. However, the perceived odour may vary in intensity, or the individual may be unable or unwilling to remove camouflaging odours (e.g. perfume), which may make it difficult to judge how noticeable the odour is. In such cases, corroborative evidence may be required from a knowledgeable informant or physician who has conducted a physical examination of the individual. Boundary with normality (threshold) • Fear of emitting offensive odours is, to some extent, common in many cultures. However, olfactory reference disorder can be differentiated from normal concerns by the degree of preoccupation and frequency of related recurrent behaviours performed, as well as the degree of distress or interference the individual experiences as a consequence of these symptoms.
