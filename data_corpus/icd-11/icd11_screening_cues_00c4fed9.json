Additional clinical features • Dementia due to pellagra is caused by persistent lack of vitamin B (niacin) or tryptophan 3 either in the diet or due to poor absorption in the gastrointestinal tract due to disease (e.g. Crohn disease) or due to the effects of some medications (e.g. isoniazid). • Core signs of pellagra include dermatological changes (sensitivity to sunlight, lesions, alopecia and oedema) and diarrhoea. • With prolonged nutritional deficiency, neurocognitive symptoms that include aggression, motor disturbances (ataxia and restlessness), confusion and weakness may be observed. • Treatment with nutritional supplementation (e.g. niacin) typically results in reversal of symptoms. Note: a diagnosis of 5B5C.0 Pellagra in Chapter 5 on endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases should also be assigned. 6D85.9 Dementia due to Down syndrome Essential (required) features • All diagnostic requirements for dementia are met. • Dementia is presumed to be attributable to Down syndrome, as demonstrated by neuropsychological test data, genetic testing, medical tests and/or clinical history. Additional clinical features • Dementia due to Down syndrome is caused by abnormal increased production and accumulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to formation of beta-amyloid Neurocognitive disorders | Dementia due to diseases classified elsewhere Neurocognitive disorders | Dementia due to diseases classified elsewhere Neurocognitive disorders 633 plaques and tau tangles. APP gene expression is increased due to its location on chromosome 21, which is abnormally triplicated in Down syndrome. Dementia due to Down syndrome may affect 50% or more of individuals with Down syndrome. • Neurocognitive deficits and neuropathological features are similar to those observed in Alzheimer disease. • Onset is typically after the fourth",
