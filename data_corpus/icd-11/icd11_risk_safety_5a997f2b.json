The disparity in prevalence across settings has been attributed to gender role expectations, such that men experiencing greater severity of symptoms are more willing to seek professional services. • Women report greater symptom severity and a greater variety of social fears, whereas men are more likely to experience anxiety related to dating and urinating in public. • Co-occurring depressive, bipolar and anxiety and fear-related disorders are more common among women, whereas men are more likely to experience co-occurring oppositional defiant disorder, conduct-dissocial disorder and disorders due to substance use. • The use of alcohol and illicit drugs to relieve symptoms of social anxiety disorder is more common among men.

Unlike social anxiety disorder, embarrassment in agoraphobia is secondary to concerns that escape or obtaining assistance may not be possible should symptoms (e.g. diarrhoea in a public place) occur.
