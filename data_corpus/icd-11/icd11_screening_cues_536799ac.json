If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort. Additional clinical features for trance disorder and possession trance disorder • Trance and possession trance disorders tend to involve recurrent episodes rather than a persistent trance or possession trance state. To qualify for a diagnosis, a single, persistent trance or possession trance state must last for at least several days. • Possession trance disorder is usually characterized by full or partial amnesia for the trance episode. Full or partial amnesia may also occur in trance disorder. • The actions performed during a trance state (e.g. staring, falling) are generally not complex, whereas during possession trance states the activities performed are often more complex (e.g. coherent conversations, characteristic gestures, facial expressions, specific verbalizations), and are frequently culturally accepted as belonging to a particular possessing agent. These behaviours or movements are often stereotyped, and may reflect cultural influences. • Presumed possessing agents in possession trance disorder are usually spiritual in nature (e.g. spirits of the dead, gods, demons or other spiritual entities), and are often experienced as making demands or expressing animosity. Boundary with normality (threshold) for trance disorder and possession trance disorder • A diagnosis of trance disorder or possession trance disorder should not be applied to experiences that are accepted in the individual’s context as collective cultural phenomena or as a part of religious practices. Moreover, the diagnoses should not be applied to trance episodes when these do not result in significant distress or impairment in functioning. • Single and transitory (minutes to hours) trance or possession trance experiences that are mildly distressing or impairing may occur under stressful circumstances, especially in the context of pre-existing mood disorders or anxiety and fear-related disorders. These single, transitory states are not a sufficient basis for a diagnosis of trance disorder or possession trance disorder.
