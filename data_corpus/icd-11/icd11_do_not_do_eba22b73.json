Boundary with other mental disorders The occurrence or a history of behaviours involving observing an unsuspecting individual who is naked, in the process of disrobing, or engaging in sexual activity is insufficient to establish a diagnosis of voyeuristic disorder. Rather, these behaviours must reflect a sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal. When this is not the case, other causes of the behaviour need to be considered. For example, voyeuristic behaviours that do not reflect an underlying, persistent pattern of sexual arousal may occur in the context of some mental disorders, such as bipolar type I disorder during manic or mixed episodes, or dementia. Boundary with sexual crimes that do not involve a paraphilic disorder Sexual crimes involving voyeuristic behaviour may consist of actions or behaviours that are not associated with a sustained underlying paraphilic arousal pattern. Rather, these behaviours may be transient and occur impulsively or opportunistically. The diagnosis of voyeuristic disorder requires these behaviours to be a manifestation of a sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal. 6D32 Paedophilic disorder Essential (required) features • A sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal – as manifested in persistent sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges or behaviours – involving pre-pubertal children is required for diagnosis. • The individual must have acted on these thoughts, fantasies or urges, or be markedly distressed by them. • The diagnosis does not apply to sexual arousal and accompanying behaviour between pre- or post-pubertal children who are close in age. Additional clinical features • Paedophilic disorder should not be diagnosed among children, and should be diagnosed only with the utmost caution among adolescents. Sexual experimentation is typical during adolescence, and sexual acts may occur impulsively or opportunistically rather than representing a recurrent pattern of sexual arousal.
