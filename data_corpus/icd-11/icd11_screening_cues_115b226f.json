  "text_en": "Dissociative disorders 371 • Gait disturbances and non-epileptic seizures are the most prominent and the most frequent symptoms of dissociative neurological symptom disorder in children and adolescents. The range and number of symptoms observed often expands with age and duration of the disorder. • The most common psychosocial stressors associated with dissociative neurological symptom disorder in children include bullying or victimization, school-related stressors, family conflict or parental separation, and the death of a relative or friend. • Individuals with dissociative neurological symptom disorder often grow up in families that are excessively preoccupied with illness. • Adolescents with dissociative neurological symptom disorder frequently have co-occurring mood disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders, and other medical symptoms. Mood and/or anxiety and fear-related disorders often persist even after remission of the symptoms of dissociative neurological symptom disorder. Among adolescents, dissociative neurological symptom disorder is more likely to be transient. Culture-related features • Symptoms of dissociative neurological symptom disorder that are typical in one cultural context may be considered unusual in another, such as localized heat sensations, “peppery” feelings on the skin, and sensations of being touched or pushed. These symptoms may be connected to local expressions of distress that reference cultural explanations of etiology (e.g. spiritual origins) or pathophysiology (e.g. subtle energies). Alternatively, in some cultures, dissociative symptoms may be attributed to an undiagnosed physical illness, such as occurs in hypochondriasis (health anxiety disorder); response to reassurance may suggest hypochondriasis rather than a dissociative disorder. • Dissociative seizures and convulsions tend to have higher prevalence in low- and middle- income countries and communities. Variations in prevalence may reflect greater traumatic exposure, sanctions against verbal expressions of disagreement by people with marginalized status, or cultures in which somatic expressions of distress are more common. Lower prevalence of dissociative symptoms may be related to negative cultural views of such “out- of-control” behaviour. Sex- and/or gender-related features • Dissociative neurological symptom disorder is 2–3 times more frequently diagnosed among females, who also have a younger age of onset. • In men, dissociative neurological symptom disorder is associated with a history of industrial, military or other occupational accident. In women, symptoms are more often linked to stress caused by family or other interpersonal interactions. Dissociative disorders | Dissociative neurological",
