  "text_en": "152 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis) Boundary with autism spectrum disorder Repetitive and stereotyped motor movements such as whole-body movements (e.g. rocking), gait atypicalities (e.g. walking on tiptoes) and unusual hand or finger movements can be a characteristic feature of autism spectrum disorder, but are differentiated from stereotyped movement disorder by the presence of additional significant limitations in the capacity for reciprocal social interactions and social communication. Assignment of both diagnoses may be warranted if the stereotyped motor movements constitute a separate focus of clinical attention (e.g. due to self-injury). Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorder In contrast to stereotyped movement disorder, repetitive behaviours (i.e. compulsions) observed in obsessive-compulsive disorder are typically more complex, and are aimed at neutralizing unwanted intrusive thoughts (i.e. obsessions) and reducing associated negative emotions (e.g. anxiety). Boundary with body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders Body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders (e.g. trichotillomania and excoriation disorder) are characterized by recurrent and habitual behaviours directed at the integument (e.g. hair and skin). In contrast, stereotyped movements in stereotyped movement disorder rarely include hair-pulling or skin-picking behaviour; if they do, the behaviour tends to be composed of coordinated movements that are patterned and predictable, utilizing the same muscle groups in a particular sequence to produce the behaviour. In addition, stereotyped movements are more likely to present very early in life (below 2 years of age), whereas body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders typically have an onset in later childhood or early adolescence. Boundary with Tourette syndrome and other tic disorders In contrast to tic disorders including Tourette syndrome, stereotyped movements in stereotyped movement disorder tend to be composed of coordinated movements that are patterned and predictable, and can be interrupted with distraction. Stereotyped movement disorder is further differentiated from tics and Tourette syndrome because the symptoms tend to emerge at a younger age, last longer than typical tics, lack a premonitory sensory urge, and may be experienced as enjoyable. Boundary with drug-induced dystonia (tardive dyskinesia). Drug-induced dystonia is a movement disorder (classified in Chapter 8 on diseases of the nervous system) that is most frequently caused by antipsychotic medication. It is also sometimes referred to as tardive dyskinesia. Symptoms",
