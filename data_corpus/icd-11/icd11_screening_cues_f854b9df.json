  "text_en": "Elimination disorders 421 Elimination disorders Elimination disorders include the repeated voiding of urine into bed or clothes (enuresis) and the repeated passage of faeces in inappropriate places (encopresis). These conditions occur in individuals at a developmental age when urinary and faecal continence is ordinarily expected to have been achieved, and may be voluntary or involuntary. Elimination disorders include the following: 6C00 Enuresis 6C01 Encopresis 6C0Z Elimination disorder, unspecified. 6C00 Enuresis Essential (required) features • Repeated and persistent voiding of urine into bed or clothes (e.g. several times per week over several months), which may occur during the day or at night, is required for diagnosis. • The individual has reached a developmental age when urinary continence is ordinarily expected (approximately equivalent to a chronological age of 5 years). • The symptoms are not better accounted for by the physiological effects of a substance or medication, or by another medical condition that causes polyuria or urgency (e.g. a urinary tract infection, untreated diabetes mellitus, a neurogenic bladder, a disease of the nervous system, a disease of the musculoskeletal system or connective tissue, congenital or acquired abnormalities of the urinary tract). Note: The symptom category MF50.2 Urinary incontinence or one of its subcategories from Chapter 21 on symptoms, signs or clinical findings, not elsewhere classified, may be considered when the presentation does not meet the diagnostic requirements for enuresis. The diagnosis for any underlying medical condition believed to be causing the urinary incontinence should also be assigned.
