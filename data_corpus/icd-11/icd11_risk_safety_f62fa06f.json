  "text_en": "146 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders • Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is associated with an increased risk of physical health problems including accidents. • Acute onset of hyperactive behaviour in a school-aged child or adolescent should raise the possibility that symptoms are better accounted for by another mental disorder or by a medical condition. For example, abrupt onset of hyperactivity in adolescence or adulthood may indicate an emergent primary psychotic or bipolar disorder. • Although attention deficit hyperactivity disorder tends to run in families, with evidence of high heritability, the predominant symptom pattern in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in a given individual often changes over time and cannot be predicted based on the predominant symptoms of other family members. Boundary with normality (threshold) • Inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms are present in many children, adolescents and adults, especially during certain developmental periods (e.g. early childhood). The diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder requires that these symptoms be persistent across time, pervasive across situations and significantly out of keeping with developmental level, and have a direct negative impact on academic, occupational or social functioning. Course features • Nearly half of all children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder will continue to exhibit symptoms into adolescence. Predictors of persistence into adolescence and adulthood include co-occurring childhood-onset mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders, lower intellectual functioning, poorer social functioning and behavioural problems. • Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms tend to remain stable throughout adolescence, with approximately one third of individuals diagnosed in childhood continuing to experience impairment in adulthood. • Although symptoms of hyperactivity become less overt during adolescence and adulthood, individuals may still experience difficulties with inattention, impulsivity and restlessness. Developmental presentations • Adolescents and adults may only seek clinical services after 12 years of age, once symptoms become more limiting with increasing social, emotional and academic demands or in the context of an evolving co-occurring mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder that results in an exacerbation of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms.
