Stools are typically – but not always – poorly formed (loose or liquid), and leakage may range from occasional to continuous. • There is often a history of toilet avoidance leading to constipation. 6C01.1 Encopresis without constipation and overflow incontinence • Encopresis without constipation and overflow incontinence is not associated with retention and impaction of faeces but rather is characterized by reluctance, resistance or failure to conform to social norms in defecating in acceptable places in the context of normal physiological control over defecation. • Stools are typically of normal consistency, and inappropriate defecation is likely to be intermittent. 6C01.Z Encopresis, unspecified Additional clinical features • Encopresis is most often involuntary but, in some cases, may appear to be voluntary. The diagnosis can be assigned in either case. Involuntary passage of faeces is most often associated with encopresis with constipation and overflow incontinence. • Encopresis that is intentional may be associated with oppositional defiant disorder or conduct-dissocial disorder. • Stool withholding, or retentive behaviours, may be the result of avoidance of bowel movements, especially in those individuals with a history of difficulty or pain in passing stools. Individuals with chronic constipation and stool retention may go on to develop acquired megacolon. • Specific phobias or social anxiety disorder (e.g. fear of using public bathrooms) may also contribute to retentive behaviours. • Encopresis is common among individuals with disorders of intellectual development. The diagnosis should only be assigned if all diagnostic requirements are met, and the individual’s developmental age is equivalent to that at which faecal continence in normally expected (approximately equivalent to a chronological age of 4 years).
