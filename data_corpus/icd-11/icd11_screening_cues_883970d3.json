  "text_en": "Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders 6A01 Developmental speech and language disorders Developmental speech and language disorders are characterized by difficulties in understanding or producing speech and language or in using language in context for the purposes of communication. Developmental speech of language disorders include: 6A01.0 Developmental speech sound disorder 6A01.1 Developmental speech fluency disorder 6A01.2 Developmental language disorder 6A01.Y Other specified developmental speech or language disorder 6A01.Z Developmental speech or language disorder, unspecified. Regional, social or cultural/ethnic language variations (e.g. dialects) must be considered when an individual is being assessed for language abilities. For example, phonological memory tasks may offer a less biased assessment compared to lexical tasks. A language history documenting all the languages the child has been exposed to since birth can assist in determining whether individual language variations are better explained by exposure to multiple languages rather than a speech or language pathology per se. 6A01.0 Developmental speech sound disorder Essential (required) features • Persistent errors of pronunciation, articulation or phonology (i.e. how language-based sounds are combined in culture-typical speech) that manifest as developmentally typical speech sound errors that persist substantially beyond the expected age or as atypical speech sound errors for the language spoken (e.g. word initial consonant deletion for English- speaking children) are required for diagnosis. • The onset of speech sound difficulties occurs during the early developmental period. • Speech sound difficulties result in significant limitations in the ability to communicate due to reduced intelligibility of speech. • The speech errors are not better accounted for by a disease of the nervous system affecting the brain, peripheral nerves or neuromusculature (e.g. cerebral palsy, myasthenia gravis); a sensory impairment (e.g. sensory neural deafness); or a structural abnormality (e.g. cleft palate) or other medical condition. Additional clinical features • Children with developmental speech sound disorder may exhibit delays in the acquisition, production and perception of spoken language.
