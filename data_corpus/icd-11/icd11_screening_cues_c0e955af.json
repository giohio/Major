A diagnosis of serotonin syndrome involves the clinical judgement that exposure to a serotonergic medication or an interaction between serotonergic medications (e.g. when increasing the dose of a medication or adding a new medication) is the cause of the symptoms, based on the timing of the symptoms in relation to medication use. Serotonin syndrome is more likely to present with tremor, hyperactive muscle reflexes (including clonus) and nystagmus than catatonia. However, the presence of these symptoms does not exclude the possibility of co-occurring catatonia. Boundary of catatonia with malingering or factitious disorder Malingering and factitious disorder are both diagnosed based on evidence of feigning of symptoms, which may include catatonic symptoms. Evidence for feigning often includes the observation that the symptoms occur only when the person is being watched. However, disturbances of volition in catatonia (e.g. negativism) may only become apparent during social interactions, which should not by itself be interpreted as evidence of feigning.
