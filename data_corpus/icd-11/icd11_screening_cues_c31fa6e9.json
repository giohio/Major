Delirium often includes disturbance of behaviour and emotion, and may include impairment in multiple cognitive domains. Disturbance of the sleep-wake cycle may also be present. Delirium may occur as an aspect of substance withdrawal, particularly during later stages of withdrawal. In such cases, diagnoses of both substance withdrawal and substance- induced delirium should be assigned. Note: substance-induced delirium is only applicable for some substances or substance classes (see Table 6.14, p. 454). Boundary with other substance-induced mental disorders Mental or behavioural symptoms that arise during substance withdrawal should only be used as a basis for diagnosing a substance-induced mental disorder if the intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of those that are characteristic of the substance withdrawal due to the specified substance (see Table 6.16, p. 484), and the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant specific clinical attention. In such cases, if the withdrawal syndrome is ongoing, diagnoses of both substance withdrawal and a substance-induced mental disorder may be assigned. Boundary with other mental disorders Various symptoms associated with substance withdrawal overlap with those that are characteristic of other mental disorders (e.g. depressive and anxiety symptoms). Symptoms of substance withdrawal occur in specific temporal relationship to the cessation of use of a specific substance, and diminish with the passage of time. Evidence supporting a mental disorder diagnosis would include the symptoms preceding the onset of the substance use, the symptoms persisting for a substantial period of time after cessation of the substance or medication use or withdrawal (e.g. 1 month or more, depending on the substance), or other evidence of a pre-existing mental disorder (e.g. a history of prior episodes not associated with substance use). Boundary with other medical conditions It may be difficult to distinguish between various symptoms associated with substance withdrawal (e.g. nausea, retching or vomiting, seizures, abdominal cramps, diarrhoea, perspiration, postural hypotension, decreased or increased heart rate, cough, sleep disruption) and those that are characteristic of other medical conditions. Symptoms of substance withdrawal occur in specific temporal relationship to the cessation of use of a specific substance and diminish with the passage of time.

Substance withdrawal is a cluster of symptoms, behaviours and physiological features, varying in degree of severity and duration, that occur upon cessation or reduction of use of a psychoactive substance in individuals who have developed dependence on that substance, or who have taken the substance for a prolonged period or in large amounts.
