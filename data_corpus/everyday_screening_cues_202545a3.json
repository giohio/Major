  "text_en": "Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders 333 associated with distinct intent for each diagnostic entity. Individuals diagnosed with obsessive- compulsive disorder may engage in skin-picking behaviour (e.g. when they experience contamination obsessions that are associated with behaviours intended to pick the skin to remove contamination). Obsessions do not precede skin picking in excoriation disorder, and individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder often exhibit other compulsions that are unrelated to skin picking. Nonetheless, co-occurrence with obsessive-compulsive disorder is common, and both disorders may be diagnosed if warranted. Body dysmorphic disorder may be associated with picking as a means of improving the individual’s appearance by “removing” acne or other perceived blemishes of the skin that the individual believes are ugly or that appear abnormal. Individuals with excoriation disorder do not pick skin with the sole purpose of correcting a perceived defect in appearance. Boundary with stereotyped movement disorder Stereotyped movement disorder is characterized by the persistent (e.g. lasting for several months) presence of voluntary, repetitive, stereotyped, apparently purposeless and often rhythmic movements (e.g. body rocking, hand flapping, head banging, eye poking and hand biting). These behaviours rarely include skin-picking behaviour, but if they do, the behaviour tends to be composed of coordinated movements that are patterned and predictable. Furthermore, stereotyped movements are more likely to present very early in life (i.e. before 2 years of age), whereas excoriation disorder typically has a later onset. Boundary with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders Individuals with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders may pick at their skin in response to a delusion or hallucination. Individuals with excoriation disorder do not report skin picking secondary to delusions or hallucinations. Boundary with Prader-Willi syndrome Individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome may have early onset of skin picking more consistent with a stereotyped movement disorder. Prader-Willi syndrome is usually associated with a constellation of other symptoms, such as mild to moderate disorder of intellectual development, neonatal and infantile hypotonia, feeding problems and poor weight gain in infancy, followed by hyperphagia and morbid obesity in childhood. Boundary with medical conditions classified elsewhere and disorders due to substance use The symptoms of excoriation disorder are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. scabies). However, skin picking may emerge following or be worsened by the presence of another condition (e.g. acne),",
