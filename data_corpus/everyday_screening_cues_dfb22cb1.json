Additional clinical features • Dementia due to prion disease is caused by a group of spongiform encephalopathies resulting from abnormal prion protein accumulation in the brain. These can be sporadic, genetic (caused by mutations in the prion protein gene) or transmissible (acquired from an infected individual). • Onset is insidious, and progression of symptoms and impairment is rapid, often characterized by neurocognitive deficits, ataxia and motor symptoms (e.g. myoclonus, chorea or dystonia). • Diagnosis is typically made on the basis of clinical presentation, brain imaging studies, presence of characteristic proteins in spinal fluid, EEG and/or genetic testing. Note: an appropriate diagnosis from the Human prion diseases grouping in Chapter 8 on diseases of the nervous system should also be assigned. 6D85.6 Dementia due to normal-pressure hydrocephalus Essential (required) features • All diagnostic requirements for dementia are met. • Dementia is presumed to be attributable to underlying normal-pressure hydrocephalus, as demonstrated by neuropsychological test data, neuroimaging data, medical tests and/ or clinical history.
