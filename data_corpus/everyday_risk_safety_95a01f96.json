Positive symptoms include delusions, hallucinations (most commonly verbal auditory hallucinations), disorganized thinking (formal thought disorder such as loose associations, thought derailment or incoherence), disorganized behaviour (behaviour that appears bizarre, purposeless and not goal-directed), and experiences of passivity and control (the experience that one’s feelings, impulses or thoughts are under the control of an external force). Abnormal psychomotor behaviour (e.g. catatonic restlessness or agitation, waxy flexibility, negativism) is not included in this domain but instead would be rated in the 6A25.4 Psychomotor symptoms domain below.

Hallucinations Hallucinations are recurrent but relatively infrequent, and the person expresses only minimal distress regarding their content. Experiences of passivity and control Some distortions of self-experience are present, such as feeling that one’s thoughts are not one’s own, but these are relatively infrequent and there is only minimal associated distress. Disorganized thinking Some circumstantial or tangential thought processes are present, but for the most part the individual is able to convey the point of the intended communication. Disorganized behaviour Infrequent episodes of purposeless behaviour that is not goal-directed and causes only minimal impairment in functioning are present. Moderate Example symptoms (not all are required) 6A25.0&XS0T Delusions The person’s behaviour is clearly affected by the delusional beliefs but the person’s behavioural response does not significantly impair functioning (e.g. a person with persecutory delusions is watchful of their surroundings but continues to venture outside). Hallucinations Hallucinations are relatively frequent and may be distressing at times but are tolerated at other times, and do not persistently preoccupy the person. The content of hallucinations may prompt action, but the person only inconsistently or occasionally responds, and these actions do not put the person or others at risk of harm.
