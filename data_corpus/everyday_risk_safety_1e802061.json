Individuals with co-occurring disorders typically experience more impairment than individuals with a single diagnosis. Neurodevelopmental disorders | Developmental motor coordination disorder Neurodevelopmental disorders 141 Developmental presentations • The prevalence of developmental motor coordination disorder is approximately 5–6% of children aged 5–11 years, although up to 10% of children may have less severe difficulties with motor skills that still affect academic and social functioning. • The manifestation of developmental motor coordination disorder symptoms varies with developmental stage. Preschool In preschool-aged children, delays in meeting one or more motor milestones (e.g. sitting, crawling, walking) or in developing specific skills (e.g. climbing stairs, buttoning clothing, tying shoes) may be evident. Middle childhood In middle childhood, symptoms may be evident in activities such as handwriting, playing with a ball, or building puzzles or models. Adolescence and adulthood By adolescence and adulthood, difficulties in motor coordination may manifest in attempts to master new skills, such as driving, using tools or note taking. All developmental stages Across all developmental stages, even once a skill is acquired, the execution of movements tends to be more awkward and less precise than in typically developing peers. • Children with developmental motor coordination disorder may also be at increased risk of co-occurring disruptive behaviour problems, anxiety and depression. In addition, children with developmental motor coordination disorder tend to report lower levels of self-efficacy and competence in physical and social abilities, and are at heightened risk of becoming overweight or obese compared to their typically developing peers. Sex- and/or gender-related features • Developmental motor coordination disorder more frequently affects boys, with a ratio of boys to girls of between 2:1 and 7:1.
