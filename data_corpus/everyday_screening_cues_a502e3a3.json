A lower frequency threshold (e.g. several times over the course of a year) may be used for high-intensity outbursts with serious negative consequences, such as physically assaulting another person, whereas a higher frequency threshold (e.g. two or more times per week) should be used for episodes characterized by verbal aggression or non-assaultive and non-destructive physical aggression. • The aggressive behaviours are clearly impulsive or reactive in nature, and represent a failure to control aggressive impulse.
