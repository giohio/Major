Examples include divorce or loss of a relationship, loss of a job, diagnosis of an illness, recent onset of a disability, and conflicts at home or work. • The reaction to the stressor is characterized by preoccupation with the stressor or its consequences, including excessive worry, recurrent and distressing thoughts about the stressor, or constant rumination about its implications. • The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. a mood disorder, another disorder specifically associated with stress). • Once the stressor and its consequences have ended, the symptoms resolve within 6 months. • Failure to adapt to the stressor results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort. Additional clinical features • Symptoms of preoccupation may worsen with reminders of the stressor, resulting in avoidance of stimuli, thoughts, feelings or discussions associated with the stressor to prevent preoccupation or distress. • Additional psychological symptoms of adjustment disorder may include depressive or anxiety symptoms, as well as impulsive “externalizing” symptoms – particularly increased tobacco, alcohol or other substance use. • Symptoms of adjustment disorder usually abate when the stressor is removed, when sufficient support is provided, or when the affected person develops additional coping mechanisms or strategies. Boundary with normality (threshold) • Adjustment disorder represents a maladaptive reaction and failure to adapt to a stressor that is associated with significant preoccupation, and results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Emotional reactions to negative life events that do not meet these requirements should not be diagnosed as adjustment disorder. Disorders specifically associated with stress | Adjustment disorder",
