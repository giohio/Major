Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis) Boundary with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder The psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia and in schizoaffective disorder last for at least 1 month in their full, florid form and tend to be more stable or fixed (e.g. having the same delusion for a period of months). In contrast, the symptoms in acute and transient psychotic disorder tend to fluctuate rapidly in intensity and type across time, such that the content and focus of delusions or hallucinations often shift, even on a daily basis. Negative symptoms may be present in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, but do not occur in acute and transient psychotic disorder. The duration of acute and transient psychotic disorder does not exceed 3 months, and most often lasts from a few days to 1 month, compared to a much longer typical course for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Finally, in contrast to schizophrenia, where the onset is often preceded by a history of poor premorbid adjustment, in acute and transient psychotic disorder the person’s symptoms progress rapidly without a prodromal period. In cases that meet both the diagnostic requirements for acute and transient psychotic disorder (i.e. fluctuating symptoms, acute onset, duration less than 3 months) and schizophrenia (e.g. delusions and hallucinations for more than 1 month) in the absence of a previous history of schizophrenia, a diagnosis of acute and transient psychotic disorder and not schizophrenia should be assigned. Boundary with mood disorders with psychotic symptoms Depressive and bipolar disorders are characterized by a predominant disturbance in mood that persists for at least several days and often much longer. Although mood symptoms may occur in acute and transient psychotic disorder, they are transient and do not meet the required duration or associated symptoms to qualify for a depressive, manic or mixed episode. Boundary with acute stress reaction and dissociative disorders Like acute and transient psychotic disorder, acute stress reaction and some dissociative disorders have an acute onset, often in response to a stressful life experience, and resolve in days to weeks. In contrast, by definition, acute and transient psychotic disorder includes psychotic symptoms like hallucinations or delusions that do not occur in disorders specifically associated with stress or in dissociative disorders.
