Nonetheless, such individuals may present many needs for support and interventions that are similar to those of people with disorders of intellectual development. Neurodevelopmental disorders | Disorders of intellectual development Neurodevelopmental disorders 97 Course features • Disorders of intellectual development are lifespan conditions that typically manifest during early childhood and require consideration of developmental phases and life transitions whereby periods of relatively greater need may alternate with those where less support may be necessary. • Disorders of intellectual development may show individual as well as etiology-specific variation in developmental trajectories (i.e. periods of relative decline or amelioration in functioning). Intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour can vary substantially across the lifespan. Results from a single assessment, particularly those obtained during early childhood, may be of limited predictive use, as later functioning will be influenced by the level and type of interventions and support provided. • People with disorders of intellectual development typically need exceptional support throughout the lifespan, although the types and intensities of required support often change over time depending on age, development, environmental factors and life circumstances. Most people with disorders of intellectual development continue to acquire skills and competencies over time. Providing interventions and support – including education – assists with this process and, if provided during the developmental period, may result in lower support needs in adulthood. Developmental presentations • There is wide variability in the developmental presentation and developmental trajectories of individuals with disorders of intellectual development. Tables 6.2–6.4 provide clinicians with some of the key areas of strengths and weaknesses typically observed at different time points across development (i.e. early childhood, childhood, adolescence and adulthood) in individuals with disorders of intellectual development. • Conditions related to disorders of intellectual development may be suspected during the first days and months of life due to the presence of certain physical signs such as facial dimorphisms, congenital malformation, micro- or macrocephalia, low weight, hypotonia, physical growth retardation, metabolic problems and failure to thrive, among others. • In older children, disorders of intellectual development may manifest as problems in acquiring academic knowledge and abilities such as reading, writing and arithmetic. Many children with mild disorder of intellectual development may not be referred for evaluation until they reach school age. Some individuals may remain undiagnosed until much later, during adolescence or adulthood. • The manifestations of disorders of intellectual development during late adolescence and the first years of adulthood may be strongly influenced by the presence of challenges related to assuming adult roles, such as postsecondary education, employment, independent living and adult relationships. • Older adults with disorders of intellectual development may present with a more rapid onset of dementia or declining skills than older adults in the general population. They also have significantly more difficulty gaining access to necessary support and appropriate health care for medical problems.
