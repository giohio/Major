Preface
The publication of DSM-5 brings innovations to the coding,
classification, and diagnosis of mental disorders that have far-reach-
ing effects across many disciplines. For quick reference, clinicians
may find useful a small and convenient manual that contains only
the DSM-5 Classification (i.e., the list of disorders, subtypes, specifi-
ers, and diagnostic codes), sections describing the use of the manual,
and diagnostic criteria sets. The Desk Reference to the Diagnostic Cri-
teria From DSM-5 is meant to be used in conjunction with the full
DSM-5. Its proper use requires familiarity with the text descriptions
for each disorder that accompany the criteria sets.
This handy reference provides all ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM
codes, coding notes, and recording procedures included in DSM-5.
Clinicians will find additional reference information in DSM-5, in-
cluding Section III: Emerging Measures and Models (containing as-
sessment measures, cultural formulation and interviews, an alterna-
tive DSM-5 model for personality disorders, and conditions for further
study) and the DSM-5 Appendix (containing highlights of changes
from DSM-IV, glossaries of technical and cultural terms, and alpha-
betical and numerical listings of DSM-5 diagnoses and codes). Assess-
ment measures and additional information are available online at
www.psychiatry.org/dsm5.

Following chapter titles and disorder names, page numbers for
the corresponding text or criteria are included in parentheses.

Use of the Manual
The primary purpose of DSM-5 is to assist trained clinicians in the
diagnosis of their patients’ mental disorders as part of a case formula-
tion assessment that leads to a fully informed treatment plan for each
individual. The symptoms contained in the respective diagnostic cri-
teria sets do not constitute comprehensive definitions of underlying
disorders, which encompass cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and
physiological processes that are far more complex than can be de-
scribed in these brief summaries. Rather, they are intended to summa-
rize characteristic syndromes of signs and symptoms that point to an
underlying disorder with a characteristic developmental history, bio-
logical and environmental risk factors, neuropsychological and phys-
iological correlates, and a typical clinical course.
Approach to Clinical Case Formulation
The case formulation for any given patient must involve a careful clini-
cal history and concise summary of the social, psychological, and bio-
logical factors that may have contributed to developing a given mental
disorder. Hence, it is not sufficient to simply check off the symptoms in
the diagnostic criteria to make a mental disorder diagnosis. Although a
systematic check for the presence of these criteria as they apply to each
patient will assure a more reliable assessment, the relative severity and
valence of individual criteria and their contribution to a diagnosis re-
quire clinical judgment. The symptoms in our diagnostic criteria are
part of the relatively limited repertoire of human emotional responses to
internal and external stresses that are generally maintained in a homeo-
static balance without a disruption in normal functioning. It requires
clinical training to recognize when the combination of predisposing,
precipitating, perpetuating, and protective factors has resulted in a psy-
chopathological condition in which physical signs and symptoms ex-
ceed normal ranges. The ultimate goal of a clinical case formulation is to
use the available contextual and diagnostic information in developing a
comprehensive treatment plan that is informed by the individual’s cul-
tural and social context. However, recommendations for the selection
3

4 Use of the Manual
and use of the most appropriate evidence-based treatment options for
each disorder are beyond the scope of this manual.
Although decades of scientific effort have gone into developing
the diagnostic criteria sets for the disorders included in Section II, it
is well recognized that this set of categorical diagnoses does not fully
describe the full range of mental disorders that individuals experi-
ence and present to clinicians on a daily basis throughout the world.
The range of genetic/environmental interactions over the course of
human development affecting cognitive, emotional and behavioral
function is virtually limitless. As a result, it is impossible to capture
the full range of psychopathology in the categorical diagnostic cate-
gories that we are now using. Hence, it is also necessary to include
“other specified/unspecified” disorder options for presentations that
do not fit exactly into the diagnostic boundaries of disorders in each
chapter. In an emergency department setting, it may be possible to
identify only the most prominent symptom expressions associated
with a particular chapter—for example, delusions, hallucinations, ma-
nia, depression, anxiety, substance intoxication, or neurocognitive
symptoms—so that an “unspecified” disorder in that category is iden-
tified until a fuller differential diagnosis is possible.
Definition of a Mental Disorder
Each disorder identified in Section II of the manual (excluding those in
the chapters entitled “Medication-Induced Movement Disorders and
Other Adverse Effects of Medication” and “Other Conditions That May
Be a Focus of Clinical Attention”) must meet the definition of a mental
disorder. Although no definition can capture all aspects of all disorders
in the range contained in DSM-5, the following elements are required:
A mental disorder is a syndrome characterized by clini-
cally significant disturbance in an individual’s cognition,
emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction
in the psychological, biological, or developmental pro-
cesses underlying mental functioning. Mental disorders
are usually associated with significant distress or disabil-
ity in social, occupational, or other important activities. An
expectable or culturally approved response to a common
stressor or loss, such as the death of a loved one, is not

Use of the Manual 5
a mental disorder. Socially deviant behavior (e.g., politi-
cal, religious, or sexual) and conflicts that are primarily
between the individual and society are not mental disor-
ders unless the deviance or conflict results from a dys-
function in the individual, as described above.
The diagnosis of a mental disorder should have clinical utility: it
should help clinicians to determine prognosis, treatment plans, and po-
tential treatment outcomes for their patients. However, the diagnosis of
a mental disorder is not equivalent to a need for treatment. Need for
treatment is a complex clinical decision that takes into consideration
symptom severity, symptom salience (e.g., the presence of suicidal ide-
ation), the patient’s distress (mental pain) associated with the symp-
tom(s), disability related to the patient’s symptoms, risks and benefits
of available treatments, and other factors (e.g., psychiatric symptoms
complicating other illness). Clinicians may thus encounter individuals
whose symptoms do not meet full criteria for a mental disorder but
who demonstrate a clear need for treatment or care. The fact that some
individuals do not show all symptoms indicative of a diagnosis should
not be used to justify limiting their access to appropriate care.
Approaches to validating diagnostic criteria for discrete categorical
mental disorders have included the following types of evidence: ante-
cedent validators (similar genetic markers, family traits, temperament,
and environmental exposure), concurrent validators (similar neural
substrates, biomarkers, emotional and cognitive processing, and symp-
tom similarity), and predictive validators (similar clinical course and
treatment response). In DSM-5, we recognize that the current diagnostic
criteria for any single disorder will not necessarily identify a homoge-
neous group of patients who can be characterized reliably with all of
these validators. Available evidence shows that these validators cross
existing diagnostic boundaries but tend to congregate more frequently
within and across adjacent DSM-5 chapter groups. Until incontrovert-
ible etiological or pathophysiological mechanisms are identified to fully
validate specific disorders or disorder spectra, the most important stan-
dard for the DSM-5 disorder criteria will be their clinical utility for the
assessment of clinical course and treatment response of individuals
grouped by a given set of diagnostic criteria.
This definition of mental disorder was developed for clinical, pub-
lic health, and research purposes. Additional information is usually

required beyond that contained in the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria in or-
der to make legal judgments on such issues as criminal responsibility,
eligibility for disability compensation, and competency (see “Caution-
ary Statement for Forensic Use of DSM-5” later in this manual).
Criterion for Clinical Significance
There have been substantial efforts by the DSM-5 Task Force and the
World Health Organization (WHO) to separate the concepts of mental
disorder and disability (impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning). In the WHO system, the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD) covers all diseases and disorders,
while the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and
Health (ICF) provides a separate classification of global disability. The
WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) is based on the ICF
and has proven useful as a standardized measure of disability for men-
tal disorders. However, in the absence of clear biological markers or
clinically useful measurements of severity for many mental disorders,
it has not been possible to completely separate normal and pathologi-
cal symptom expressions contained in diagnostic criteria. This gap in
information is particularly problematic in clinical situations in which
the patient’s symptom presentation by itself (particularly in mild
forms) is not inherently pathological and may be encountered in indi-
viduals for whom a diagnosis of “mental disorder” would be inappro-
priate. Therefore, a generic diagnostic criterion requiring distress or
disability has been used to establish disorder thresholds, usually
worded “the disturbance causes clinically significant distress or im-
pairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of function-
ing.” The text following the revised definition of a mental disorder
acknowledges that this criterion may be especially helpful in determin-
ing a patient’s need for treatment. Use of information from family
members and other third parties (in addition to the individual) regard-
ing the individual’s performance is recommended when necessary.
Elements of a Diagnosis
Diagnostic Criteria and Descriptors
Diagnostic criteria are offered as guidelines for making diagnoses,
and their use should be informed by clinical judgment. The text
descriptions in DSM-5, including introductory sections of each diag-

Use of the Manual 7
nostic chapter, can help support diagnosis (e.g., providing differen-
tial diagnoses; describing the criteria more fully under “Diagnostic
Features”).
Following the assessment of diagnostic criteria, clinicians should
consider the application of disorder subtypes and/or specifiers as
appropriate. Severity and course specifiers should be applied to de-
note the individual’s current presentation, but only when the full
criteria are met. When full criteria are not met, clinicians should con-
sider whether the symptom presentation meets criteria for an “other
specified” or “unspecified” designation. Where applicable, specific
criteria for defining disorder severity (e.g., mild, moderate, severe,
extreme), descriptive features (e.g., with good to fair insight; in a
controlled environment), and course (e.g., in partial remission, in full
remission, recurrent) are provided with each diagnosis. On the basis
of the clinical interview, text descriptions, criteria, and clinician judg-
ment, a final diagnosis is made.
The general convention in DSM-5 is to allow multiple diagnoses
to be assigned for those presentations that meet criteria for more than
one DSM-5 disorder.
Subtypes and Specifiers
Subtypes and specifiers (some of which are coded in the fourth, fifth,
or sixth digit) are provided for increased specificity. Subtypes define
mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive phenomenological sub-
groupings within a diagnosis and are indicated by the instruction
“Specify whether” in the criteria set. In contrast, specifiers are not in-
tended to be mutually exclusive or jointly exhaustive, and as a con-
sequence, more than one specifier may be given. Specifiers are
indicated by the instruction “Specify” or “Specify if” in the criteria set.
Specifiers provide an opportunity to define a more homogeneous
subgrouping of individuals with the disorder who share certain fea-
tures (e.g., major depressive disorder, with mixed features) and to
convey information that is relevant to the management of the indi-
vidual’s disorder, such as the “with other medical comorbidity”
specifier in sleep-wake disorders. Although a fifth digit is sometimes
assigned to code a subtype or specifier (e.g., 294.11 [F02.81] major
neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease, with behavioral
disturbance) or severity (296.21 [F32.0] major depressive disorder, sin-
gle episode, mild), the majority of subtypes and specifiers included in

8 Use of the Manual
DSM-5 cannot be coded within the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM sys-
tems and are indicated only by including the subtype or specifier af-
ter the name of the disorder (e.g., social anxiety disorder [social
phobia], performance type). Note that in some cases, a specifier or sub-
type is codable in ICD-10-CM but not in ICD-9-CM. Accordingly, in
some cases the 4th or 5th character codes for the subtypes or specifi-
ers are provided only for the ICD-10-CM coding designations.
A DSM-5 diagnosis is usually applied to the individual’s current
presentation; previous diagnoses from which the individual has re-
covered should be clearly noted as such. Specifiers indicating course
(e.g., in partial remission, in full remission) may be listed after the di-
agnosis and are indicated in a number of criteria sets. Where avail-
able, severity specifiers are provided to guide clinicians in rating the
intensity, frequency, duration, symptom count, or other severity
indicator of a disorder. Severity specifiers are indicated by the in-
struction “Specify current severity” in the criteria set and include dis-
order-specific definitions. Descriptive features specifiers have also been
provided in the criteria set and convey additional information that
can inform treatment planning (e.g., obsessive-compulsive disorder,
with poor insight). Not all disorders include course, severity, and/or
descriptive features specifiers.
Medication-Induced Movement Disorders and Other
Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention
In addition to important psychosocial and environmental factors,
conditions that are not mental disorders but may be encountered by
mental health clinicians are included. These conditions may be listed
as a reason for clinical visit in addition to, or in place of, the mental
disorders listed in Section II. A separate chapter is devoted to medi-
cation-induced disorders and other adverse effects of medication
that may be assessed and treated by clinicians in mental health prac-
tice, such as akathisia, tardive dyskinesia, and dystonia. The descrip-
tion of neuroleptic malignant syndrome is expanded from that
provided in DSM-IV-TR to highlight the emergent and potentially
life-threatening nature of this condition, and a new entry on anti-
depressant discontinuation syndrome is provided. An additional
chapter discusses other conditions that may be a focus of clinical at-
tention. These include relational problems, problems related to abuse

Use of the Manual 9
and neglect, problems with adherence to treatment regimens, obesity,
antisocial behavior, and malingering.
Principal Diagnosis
When more than one diagnosis for an individual is given in an inpa-
tient setting, the principal diagnosis is the condition established after
study to be chiefly responsible for occasioning the admission of the
individual. When more than one diagnosis is given for an individual
in an outpatient setting, the reason for visit is the condition that is
chiefly responsible for the ambulatory care medical services received
during the visit. In most cases, the principal diagnosis or the reason
for visit is also the main focus of attention or treatment. It is often dif-
ficult (and somewhat arbitrary) to determine which diagnosis is the
principal diagnosis or the reason for visit, especially when, for exam-
ple, a substance-related diagnosis such as alcohol use disorder is
accompanied by a non-substance-related diagnosis such as schizo-
phrenia. For example, it may be unclear which diagnosis should be
considered “principal” for an individual hospitalized with both
schizophrenia and alcohol use disorder, because each condition may
have contributed equally to the need for admission and treatment.
The principal diagnosis is indicated by listing it first, and the remain-
ing disorders are listed in order of focus of attention and treatment.
When the principal diagnosis or reason for visit is a mental disorder
due to another medical condition (e.g., major neurocognitive disor-
der due to Alzheimer’s disease, psychotic disorder due to malignant
lung neoplasm), ICD coding rules require that the etiological medi-
cal condition be listed first. In that case, the principal diagnosis or
reason for visit would be the mental disorder due to the medical con-
dition, the second listed diagnosis. In most cases, the disorder listed
as the principal diagnosis or the reason for visit is followed by the
qualifying phrase “(principal diagnosis)” or “(reason for visit).”
Provisional Diagnosis
The specifier “provisional” can be used when there is a strong pre-
sumption that the full criteria will ultimately be met for a disorder but
not enough information is available to make a firm diagnosis. The
clinician can indicate the diagnostic uncertainty by recording “(pro-
visional)” following the diagnosis. For example, this diagnosis might
be used when an individual who appears to have a major depressive

10 Use of the Manual
disorder is unable to give an adequate history, and thus it cannot be
established that the full criteria are met. Another use of the term pro-
visional is for those situations in which differential diagnosis de-
pends exclusively on the duration of illness. For example, a diagnosis
of schizophreniform disorder requires a duration of less than 6 months
but of at least 1 month and can only be given provisionally if as-
signed before remission has occurred.
Coding and Reporting Procedures
Each disorder is accompanied by an identifying diagnostic and statisti-
cal code, which is typically used by institutions and agencies for data
collection and billing purposes. There are specific recording protocols
for these diagnostic codes (identified as coding notes in the text) that
were established by WHO, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s
National Center for Health Statistics to ensure consistent international
recording of prevalence and mortality rates for identified health condi-
tions. For most clinicians, the codes are used to identify the diagnosis
or reason for visit for CMS and private insurance service claims. The of-
ficial coding system in use in the United States as of publication of this
manual is ICD-9-CM. Official adoption of ICD-10-CM is scheduled to
take place on October 1, 2014, and these codes, which are shown paren-
thetically in this manual, should not be used until the official imple-
mentation occurs. Both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes have been
listed 1) preceding the name of the disorder in the classification and
2)accompanying the criteria set for each disorder. For some diagnoses
(e.g., neurocognitive and substance/medication-induced disorders),
the appropriate code depends on further specification and is listed
within the criteria set for the disorder, as coding notes, and, in some
cases, further clarified in a section on recording procedures. The names
of some disorders are followed by alternative terms enclosed in paren-
theses, which, in most cases, were the DSM-IV names for the disorders.
Looking to the Future:
Assessment and Monitoring Tools
The various components of DSM-5 are provided to facilitate patient
assessment and to aid in developing a comprehensive case formula-

tion. Whereas the diagnostic criteria in Section II are well-established
measures that have undergone extensive review, the assessment
tools, a cultural formulation interview, and conditions for further
study included in Section III are those for which we determined that
the scientific evidence is not yet available to support widespread clin-
ical use. These diagnostic aids and criteria are included to highlight
the evolution and direction of scientific advances in these areas and to
stimulate further research.
Each of the measures in Section III is provided to aid in a compre-
hensive assessment of individuals that will contribute to a diagnosis
and treatment plan tailored to the individual presentation and clini-
cal context. Where cultural dynamics are particularly important for
diagnostic assessment, the cultural formulation interview should be
considered as a useful aid to communication with the individual.
Cross-cutting symptom and diagnosis-specific severity measures pro-
vide quantitative ratings of important clinical areas that are designed
to be used at the initial evaluation to establish a baseline for compar-
ison with ratings on subsequent encounters to monitor changes and
inform treatment planning.
The use of such measures will undoubtedly be facilitated by dig-
ital applications, and the measures are included in Section III to pro-
vide for further evaluation and development. As with each DSM
edition, the diagnostic criteria and the DSM-5 classification of mental
disorders reflect the current consensus on the evolving knowledge in
our field.

Cautionary Statement for
Forensic Use of DSM-5
Although the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria and text are primarily
designed to assist clinicians in conducting clinical assessment, case
formulation, and treatment planning, DSM-5 is also used as a refer-
ence for the courts and attorneys in assessing the forensic conse-
quences of mental disorders. As a result, it is important to note that
the definition of mental disorder included in DSM-5 was developed to
meet the needs of clinicians, public health professionals, and research
investigators rather than all of the technical needs of the courts and
legal professionals. It is also important to note that DSM-5 does not
provide treatment guidelines for any given disorder.
When used appropriately, diagnoses and diagnostic information
can assist legal decision makers in their determinations. For example,
when the presence of a mental disorder is the predicate for a subse-
quent legal determination (e.g., involuntary civil commitment), the
use of an established system of diagnosis enhances the value and re-
liability of the determination. By providing a compendium based on
a review of the pertinent clinical and research literature, DSM-5 may
facilitate legal decision makers’ understanding of the relevant char-
acteristics of mental disorders. The literature related to diagnoses also
serves as a check on ungrounded speculation about mental disorders
and about the functioning of a particular individual. Finally, diag-
nostic information about longitudinal course may improve decision
making when the legal issue concerns an individual’s mental function-
ing at a past or future point in time.
However, the use of DSM-5 should be informed by an awareness
of the risks and limitations of its use in forensic settings. When DSM-5
categories, criteria, and textual descriptions are employed for foren-
sic purposes, there is a risk that diagnostic information will be mis-
used or misunderstood. These dangers arise because of the imperfect
fit between the questions of ultimate concern to the law and the in-
formation contained in a clinical diagnosis. In most situations, the
clinical diagnosis of a DSM-5 mental disorder such as intellectual dis-
13

14 Cautionary Statement for Forensic Use of DSM-5
ability (intellectual developmental disorder), schizophrenia, major
neurocognitive disorder, gambling disorder, or pedophilic disorder
does not imply that an individual with such a condition meets legal
criteria for the presence of a mental disorder or a specified legal stan-
dard (e.g., for competence, criminal responsibility, or disability). For
the latter, additional information is usually required beyond that con-
tained in the DSM-5 diagnosis, which might include information about
the individual’s functional impairments and how these impairments
affect the particular abilities in question. It is precisely because im-
pairments, abilities, and disabilities vary widely within each diagnos-
tic category that assignment of a particular diagnosis does not imply
a specific level of impairment or disability.
Use of DSM-5 to assess for the presence of a mental disorder by
nonclinical, nonmedical, or otherwise insufficiently trained individ-
uals is not advised. Nonclinical decision makers should also be cau-
tioned that a diagnosis does not carry any necessary implications re-
garding the etiology or causes of the individual’s mental disorder or
the individual’s degree of control over behaviors that may be associ-
ated with the disorder. Even when diminished control over one’s be-
havior is a feature of the disorder, having the diagnosis in itself does
not demonstrate that a particular individual is (or was) unable to con-
trol his or her behavior at a particular time.

Intellectual Disabilities
Intellectual Disability
(Intellectual Developmental Disorder)
Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) is a disor-
der with onset during the developmental period that includes both in-
tellectual and adaptive functioning deficits in conceptual, social, and
practical domains. The following three criteria must be met:
A. Deficits in intellectual functions, such as reasoning, problem solv-
ing, planning, abstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and
learning from experience, confirmed by both clinical assessment
and individualized, standardized intelligence testing.
B. Deficits in adaptive functioning that result in failure to meet devel-
opmental and sociocultural standards for personal indepen-
dence and social responsibility. Without ongoing support, the
adaptive deficits limit functioning in one or more activities of daily
life, such as communication, social participation, and indepen-
dent living, across multiple environments, such as home, school,
work, and community.
C. Onset of intellectual and adaptive deficits during the develop-
mental period.
Note: The diagnostic term intellectual disability is the equivalent
term for the ICD-11 diagnosis of intellectual developmental disor-
ders. Although the term intellectual disability is used throughout this
manual, both terms are used in the title to clarify relationships with
other classification systems. Moreover, a federal statute in the United
States (Public Law 111-256, Rosa’s Law) replaces the term mental
retardation with intellectual disability, and research journals use the
17

term intellectual disability. Thus, intellectual disability is the term in
common use by medical, educational, and other professions and by
the lay public and advocacy groups.

Global Developmental Delay 23
Global Developmental Delay
315.8 (F88)
This diagnosis is reserved for individuals under the age of 5 years
when the clinical severity level cannot be reliably assessed during
early childhood. This category is diagnosed when an individual fails
to meet expected developmental milestones in several areas of intel-
lectual functioning, and applies to individuals who are unable to un-
dergo systematic assessments of intellectual functioning, including
children who are too young to participate in standardized testing.
This category requires reassessment after a period of time.
Unspecified Intellectual Disability
(Intellectual Developmental Disorder)
319 (F79)
This category is reserved for individuals over the age of 5 years when
assessment of the degree of intellectual disability (intellectual devel-
opmental disorder) by means of locally available procedures is ren-
dered difficult or impossible because of associated sensory or physical
impairments, as in blindness or prelingual deafness; locomotor dis-
ability; or presence of severe problem behaviors or co-occurring
mental disorder. This category should only be used in exceptional cir-
cumstances and requires reassessment after a period of time.

24 Neurodevelopmental Disorders
Communication Disorders
Language Disorder
315.32 (F80.2)
A. Persistent difficulties in the acquisition and use of language across
modalities (i.e., spoken, written, sign language, or other) due to
deficits in comprehension or production that include the following:
1. Reduced vocabulary (word knowledge and use).
2. Limited sentence structure (ability to put words and word end-
ings together to form sentences based on the rules of gram-
mar and morphology).
3. Impairments in discourse (ability to use vocabulary and con-
nect sentences to explain or describe a topic or series of
events or have a conversation).
B. Language abilities are substantially and quantifiably below those
expected for age, resulting in functional limitations in effective
communication, social participation, academic achievement, or
occupational performance, individually or in any combination.
C. Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.
D. The difficulties are not attributable to hearing or other sensory im-
pairment, motor dysfunction, or another medical or neurological
condition and are not better explained by intellectual disability
(intellectual developmental disorder) or global developmental
delay.
Speech Sound Disorder
315.39 (F80.0)
A. Persistent difficulty with speech sound production that interferes
with speech intelligibility or prevents verbal communication of
messages.

Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering) 25
B. The disturbance causes limitations in effective communication
that interfere with social participation, academic achievement, or
occupational performance, individually or in any combination.
C. Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.
D. The difficulties are not attributable to congenital or acquired condi-
tions, such as cerebral palsy, cleft palate, deafness or hearing loss,
traumatic brain injury, or other medical or neurological conditions.
Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering)
315.35 (F80.81)
A. Disturbances in the normal fluency and time patterning of speech
that are inappropriate for the individual’s age and language skills,
persist over time, and are characterized by frequent and marked
occurrences of one (or more) of the following:
1. Sound and syllable repetitions.
2. Sound prolongations of consonants as well as vowels.
3. Broken words (e.g., pauses within a word).
4. Audible or silent blocking (filled or unfilled pauses in speech).
5. Circumlocutions (word substitutions to avoid problematic
words).
6. Words produced with an excess of physical tension.
7. Monosyllabic whole-word repetitions (e.g., “I-I-I-I see him”).
B. The disturbance causes anxiety about speaking or limitations in
effective communication, social participation, or academic or oc-
cupational performance, individually or in any combination.
C. The onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.
(Note: Later-onset cases are diagnosed as 307.0 [F98.5] adult-
onset fluency disorder.)
D. The disturbance is not attributable to a speech-motor or sensory
deficit, dysfluency associated with neurological insult (e.g., stroke,
tumor, trauma), or another medical condition and is not better ex-
plained by another mental disorder.

26 Neurodevelopmental Disorders
Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder
315.39 (F80.89)
A. Persistent difficulties in the social use of verbal and nonverbal
communication as manifested by all of the following:
1. Deficits in using communication for social purposes, such as
greeting and sharing information, in a manner that is appro-
priate for the social context.
2. Impairment of the ability to change communication to match
context or the needs of the listener, such as speaking differ-
ently in a classroom than on a playground, talking differently
to a child than to an adult, and avoiding use of overly formal
language.
3. Difficulties following rules for conversation and storytelling,
such as taking turns in conversation, rephrasing when mis-
understood, and knowing how to use verbal and nonverbal
signals to regulate interaction.
4. Difficulties understanding what is not explicitly stated (e.g.,
making inferences) and nonliteral or ambiguous meanings
of language (e.g., idioms, humor, metaphors, multiple mean-
ings that depend on the context for interpretation).
B. The deficits result in functional limitations in effective communica-
tion, social participation, social relationships, academic achieve-
ment, or occupational performance, individually or in combination.
C. The onset of the symptoms is in the early developmental period
(but deficits may not become fully manifest until social communi-
cation demands exceed limited capacities).
D. The symptoms are not attributable to another medical or neuro-
logical condition or to low abilities in the domains of word struc-
ture and grammar, and are not better explained by autism
spectrum disorder, intellectual disability (intellectual develop-
mental disorder), global developmental delay, or another mental
disorder.

Unspecified Communication Disorder 27
Unspecified Communication Disorder
307.9 (F80.9)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of communication disorder that cause clinically significant distress or im-
pairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning
predominate but do not meet the full criteria for communication disorder
or for any of the disorders in the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnos-
tic class. The unspecified communication disorder category is used in
situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that
the criteria are not met for communication disorder or for a specific neu-
rodevelopmental disorder, and includes presentations in which there is
insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.
Autism Spectrum Disorder
Autism Spectrum Disorder
299.00 (F84.0)
A. Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction
across multiple contexts, as manifested by the following, currently
or by history (examples are illustrative, not exhaustive):
1. Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, ranging, for example,
from abnormal social approach and failure of normal back-and-
forth conversation; to reduced sharing of interests, emotions, or
affect; to failure to initiate or respond to social interactions.
2. Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for so-
cial interaction, ranging, for example, from poorly integrated
verbal and nonverbal communication; to abnormalities in eye
contact and body language or deficits in understanding and
use of gestures; to a total lack of facial expressions and non-
verbal communication.

28 Neurodevelopmental Disorders
3. Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding rela-
tionships, ranging, for example, from difficulties adjusting be-
havior to suit various social contexts; to difficulties in sharing
imaginative play or in making friends; to absence of interest
in peers.
Specify current severity:
Severity is based on social communication impairments
and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior (see Table 2).
B. Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities,
as manifested by at least two of the following, currently or by his-
tory (examples are illustrative, not exhaustive):
1. Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects,
or speech (e.g., simple motor stereotypies, lining up toys or
flipping objects, echolalia, idiosyncratic phrases).
2. Insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines, or
ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal behavior (e.g., ex-
treme distress at small changes, difficulties with transitions,
rigid thinking patterns, greeting rituals, need to take same
route or eat same food every day).
3. Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in inten-
sity or focus (e.g., strong attachment to or preoccupation
with unusual objects, excessively circumscribed or persever-
ative interests).
4. Hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest
in sensory aspects of the environment (e.g., apparent indif-
ference to pain/temperature, adverse response to specific
sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of ob-
jects, visual fascination with lights or movement).
Specify current severity:
Severity is based on social communication impairments
and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior (see Table 2).
C. Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period (but
may not become fully manifest until social demands exceed limited
capacities, or may be masked by learned strategies in later life).
D. Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in social, occu-
pational, or other important areas of current functioning.

Autism Spectrum Disorder 29
E. These disturbances are not better explained by intellectual disabil-
ity (intellectual developmental disorder) or global developmental
delay. Intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder fre-
quently co-occur; to make comorbid diagnoses of autism spec-
trum disorder and intellectual disability, social communication
should be below that expected for general developmental level.
Note: Individuals with a well-established DSM-IV diagnosis of autis-
tic disorder, Asperger’s disorder, or pervasive developmental disor-
der not otherwise specified should be given the diagnosis of autism
spectrum disorder. Individuals who have marked deficits in social
communication, but whose symptoms do not otherwise meet criteria
for autism spectrum disorder, should be evaluated for social (prag-
matic) communication disorder.
Specify if:
With or without accompanying intellectual impairment
With or without accompanying language impairment
Associated with a known medical or genetic condition or en-
vironmental factor (Coding note: Use additional code to iden-
tify the associated medical or genetic condition.)
Associated with another neurodevelopmental, mental, or
behavioral disorder (Coding note: Use additional code[s] to
identify the associated neurodevelopmental, mental, or behav-
ioral disorder[s].)
With catatonia (refer to the criteria for catatonia associated with
another mental disorder, pp. 60–61, for definition). (Coding note:
Use additional code 293.89 [F06.1] catatonia associated with au-
tism spectrum disorder to indicate the presence of the comorbid
catatonia.)

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder 31
Recording Procedures
For autism spectrum disorder that is associated with a known medical
or genetic condition or environmental factor, or with another neurode-
velopmental, mental, or behavioral disorder, record autism spectrum
disorder associated with (name of condition, disorder, or factor) (e.g.,
autism spectrum disorder associated with Rett syndrome). Severity
should be recorded as level of support needed for each of the two psy-
chopathological domains in Table 2 (e.g., “requiring very substantial
support for deficits in social communication and requiring substantial
support for restricted, repetitive behaviors”). Specification of “with
accompanying intellectual impairment” or “without accompanying
intellectual impairment” should be recorded next. Language impair-
ment specification should be recorded thereafter. If there is accompa-
nying language impairment, the current level of verbal functioning
should be recorded (e.g., “with accompanying language impair-
ment—no intelligible speech” or “with accompanying language im-
pairment—phrase speech”). If catatonia is present, record separately
“catatonia associated with autism spectrum disorder.”
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity
Disorder
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
A. A persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity
that interferes with functioning or development, as characterized
by (1) and/or (2):
1. Inattention: Six (or more) of the following symptoms have
persisted for at least 6months to a degree that is inconsis-
tent with developmental level and that negatively impacts di-
rectly on social and academic/occupational activities:
Note: The symptoms are not solely a manifestation of oppo-
sitional behavior, defiance, hostility, or failure to understand

32 Neurodevelopmental Disorders
tasks or instructions. For older adolescents and adults (age
17 and older), at least five symptoms are required.
a. Often fails to give close attention to details or makes care-
less mistakes in schoolwork, at work, or during other activ-
ities (e.g., overlooks or misses details, work is inaccurate).
b. Often has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play
activities (e.g., has difficulty remaining focused during
lectures, conversations, or lengthy reading).
c. Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly
(e.g., mind seems elsewhere, even in the absence of
any obvious distraction).
d. Often does not follow through on instructions and fails to
finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace (e.g.,
starts tasks but quickly loses focus and is easily side-
tracked).
e. Often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities (e.g., dif-
ficulty managing sequential tasks; difficulty keeping materi-
als and belongings in order; messy, disorganized work; has
poor time management; fails to meet deadlines).
f. Often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to engage in tasks
that require sustained mental effort (e.g., schoolwork or
homework; for older adolescents and adults, preparing
reports, completing forms, reviewing lengthy papers).
g. Often loses things necessary for tasks or activities (e.g.,
school materials, pencils, books, tools, wallets, keys, pa-
perwork, eyeglasses, mobile telephones).
h. Is often easily distracted by extraneous stimuli (for older
adolescents and adults, may include unrelated thoughts).
i. Is often forgetful in daily activities (e.g., doing chores,
running errands; for older adolescents and adults, re-
turning calls, paying bills, keeping appointments).
2. Hyperactivity and impulsivity: Six (or more) of the follow-
ing symptoms have persisted for at least 6 months to a de-
gree that is inconsistent with developmental level and that
negatively impacts directly on social and academic/occupa-
tional activities:

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder 33
Note: The symptoms are not solely a manifestation of oppo-
sitional behavior, defiance, hostility, or a failure to under-
stand tasks or instructions. For older adolescents and adults
(age 17 and older), at least five symptoms are required.
a. Often fidgets with or taps hands or feet or squirms in
seat.
b. Often leaves seat in situations when remaining seated is
expected (e.g., leaves his or her place in the classroom,
in the office or other workplace, or in other situations that
require remaining in place).
c. Often runs about or climbs in situations where it is in-
appropriate. (Note: In adolescents or adults, may be lim-
ited to feeling restless.)
d. Often unable to play or engage in leisure activities quietly.
e. Is often “on the go,” acting as if “driven by a motor” (e.g.,
is unable to be or uncomfortable being still for extended
time, as in restaurants, meetings; may be experienced
by others as being restless or difficult to keep up with).
f. Often talks excessively.
g. Often blurts out an answer before a question has been
completed (e.g., completes people’s sentences; cannot
wait for turn in conversation).
h. Often has difficulty waiting his or her turn (e.g., while
waiting in line).
i. Often interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into con-
versations, games, or activities; may start using other
people’s things without asking or receiving permission; for
adolescents and adults, may intrude into or take over
what others are doing).
B. Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were
present prior to age 12 years.
C. Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms are pres-
ent in two or more settings (e.g., at home, school, or work; with
friends or relatives; in other activities).
D. There is clear evidence that the symptoms interfere with, or re-
duce the quality of, social, academic, or occupational functioning.

34 Neurodevelopmental Disorders
E. The symptoms do not occur exclusively during the course of
schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder and are not better
explained by another mental disorder (e.g., mood disorder, anx-
iety disorder, dissociative disorder, personality disorder, sub-
stance intoxication or withdrawal).
Specify whether:
314.01 (F90.2) Combined presentation: If both Criterion A1 (in-
attention) and Criterion A2 (hyperactivity-impulsivity) are met for
the past 6 months.
314.00 (F90.0) Predominantly inattentive presentation: If Cri-
terion A1 (inattention) is met but Criterion A2 (hyperactivity-
impulsivity) is not met for the past 6 months.
314.01 (F90.1) Predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presen-
tation: If Criterion A2 (hyperactivity-impulsivity) is met and Crite-
rion A1 (inattention) is not met for the past 6 months.
Specify if:
In partial remission: When full criteria were previously met,
fewer than the full criteria have been met for the past 6 months,
and the symptoms still result in impairment in social, academic,
or occupational functioning.
Specify current severity:
Mild: Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to make
the diagnosis are present, and symptoms result in no more than
minor impairments in social or occupational functioning.
Moderate: Symptoms or functional impairment between “mild”
and “severe” are present.
Severe: Many symptoms in excess of those required to make the
diagnosis, or several symptoms that are particularly severe, are
present, or the symptoms result in marked impairment in social
or occupational functioning.

Other Specified Attention-Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder 35
Other Specified Attention-Deficit/
Hyperactivity Disorder
314.01 (F90.8)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder that cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other im-
portant areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full cri-
teria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or any of the disorders
in the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The other spec-
ified attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder category is used in situations
in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that
the presentation does not meet the criteria for attention-deficit/hyper-
activity disorder or any specific neurodevelopmental disorder. This is
done by recording “other specified attention-deficit/hyperactivity dis-
order” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “with insufficient inatten-
tion symptoms”).
Unspecified Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
314.01 (F90.9)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder that cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other im-
portant areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full cri-
teria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or any of the disorders
in the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder category is used in situations
in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the crite-
ria are not met for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or for a specific
neurodevelopmental disorder, and includes presentations in which
there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

36 Neurodevelopmental Disorders
Specific Learning Disorder
Specific Learning Disorder
A. Difficulties learning and using academic skills, as indicated by
the presence of at least one of the following symptoms that have
persisted for at least 6 months, despite the provision of interven-
tions that target those difficulties:
1. Inaccurate or slow and effortful word reading (e.g., reads sin-
gle words aloud incorrectly or slowly and hesitantly, fre-
quently guesses words, has difficulty sounding out words).
2. Difficulty understanding the meaning of what is read (e.g.,
may read text accurately but not understand the sequence, re-
lationships, inferences, or deeper meanings of what is read).
3. Difficulties with spelling (e.g., may add, omit, or substitute
vowels or consonants).
4. Difficulties with written expression (e.g., makes multiple gram-
matical or punctuation errors within sentences; employs poor
paragraph organization; written expression of ideas lacks
clarity).
5. Difficulties mastering number sense, number facts, or calcula-
tion (e.g., has poor understanding of numbers, their magnitude,
and relationships; counts on fingers to add single-digit numbers
instead of recalling the math fact as peers do; gets lost in the
midst of arithmetic computation and may switch procedures).
6. Difficulties with mathematical reasoning (e.g., has severe dif-
ficulty applying mathematical concepts, facts, or procedures
to solve quantitative problems).
B. The affected academic skills are substantially and quantifiably be-
low those expected for the individual’s chronological age, and
cause significant interference with academic or occupational per-
formance, or with activities of daily living, as confirmed by indi-
vidually administered standardized achievement measures and
comprehensive clinical assessment. For individuals age 17 years
and older, a documented history of impairing learning difficulties
may be substituted for the standardized assessment.

Specific Learning Disorder 37
C. The learning difficulties begin during school-age years but may
not become fully manifest until the demands for those affected
academic skills exceed the individual’s limited capacities (e.g.,
as in timed tests, reading or writing lengthy complex reports for a
tight deadline, excessively heavy academic loads).
D. The learning difficulties are not better accounted for by intellec-
tual disabilities, uncorrected visual or auditory acuity, other men-
tal or neurological disorders, psychosocial adversity, lack of
proficiency in the language of academic instruction, or inade-
quate educational instruction.
Note: The four diagnostic criteria are to be met based on a clinical
synthesis of the individual’s history (developmental, medical, family,
educational), school reports, and psychoeducational assessment.
Coding note: Specify all academic domains and subskills that are
impaired. When more than one domain is impaired, each one should
be coded individually according to the following specifiers.
Specify if:
315.00 (F81.0) With impairment in reading:
Word reading accuracy
Reading rate or fluency
Reading comprehension
Note: Dyslexia is an alternative term used to refer to a pattern of
learning difficulties characterized by problems with accurate or
fluent word recognition, poor decoding, and poor spelling abili-
ties. If dyslexia is used to specify this particular pattern of difficul-
ties, it is important also to specify any additional difficulties that
are present, such as difficulties with reading comprehension or
math reasoning.
315.2 (F81.81) With impairment in written expression:
Spelling accuracy
Grammar and punctuation accuracy
Clarity or organization of written expression
315.1 (F81.2) With impairment in mathematics:
Number sense
Memorization of arithmetic facts

38 Neurodevelopmental Disorders
Accurate or fluent calculation
Accurate math reasoning
Note: Dyscalculia is an alternative term used to refer to a pattern
of difficulties characterized by problems processing numerical in-
formation, learning arithmetic facts, and performing accurate or
fluent calculations. If dyscalculia is used to specify this particular
pattern of mathematic difficulties, it is important also to specify
any additional difficulties that are present, such as difficulties
with math reasoning or word reasoning accuracy.
Specify current severity:
Mild: Some difficulties learning skills in one or two academic do-
mains, but of mild enough severity that the individual may be able
to compensate or function well when provided with appropriate
accommodations or support services, especially during the school
years.
Moderate: Marked difficulties learning skills in one or more aca-
demic domains, so that the individual is unlikely to become profi-
cient without some intervals of intensive and specialized teaching
during the school years. Some accommodations or supportive
services at least part of the day at school, in the workplace, or at
home may be needed to complete activities accurately and effi-
ciently.
Severe: Severe difficulties learning skills, affecting several aca-
demic domains, so that the individual is unlikely to learn those
skills without ongoing intensive individualized and specialized
teaching for most of the school years. Even with an array of ap-
propriate accommodations or services at home, at school, or in
the workplace, the individual may not be able to complete all ac-
tivities efficiently.
Recording Procedures
Each impaired academic domain and subskill of specific learning
disorder should be recorded. Because of ICD coding requirements,
impairments in reading, impairments in written expression, and im-
pairments in mathematics, with their corresponding impairments in
subskills, must be coded separately. For example, impairments in
reading and mathematics and impairments in the subskills of read-

Developmental Coordination Disorder 39
ing rate or fluency, reading comprehension, accurate or fluent calcu-
lation, and accurate math reasoning would be coded and recorded as
315.00 (F81.0) specific learning disorder with impairment in reading,
with impairment in reading rate or fluency and impairment in read-
ing comprehension; 315.1 (F81.2) specific learning disorder with im-
pairment in mathematics, with impairment in accurate or fluent
calculation and impairment in accurate math reasoning.
Motor Disorders
Developmental Coordination Disorder
315.4 (F82)
A. The acquisition and execution of coordinated motor skills is sub-
stantially below that expected given the individual’s chronologi-
cal age and opportunity for skill learning and use. Difficulties are
manifested as clumsiness (e.g., dropping or bumping into ob-
jects) as well as slowness and inaccuracy of performance of mo-
tor skills (e.g., catching an object, using scissors or cutlery,
handwriting, riding a bike, or participating in sports).
B. The motor skills deficit in Criterion A significantly and persistently
interferes with activities of daily living appropriate to chrono-
logical age (e.g., self-care and self-maintenance) and impacts
academic/school productivity, prevocational and vocational ac-
tivities, leisure, and play.
C. Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.
D. The motor skills deficits are not better explained by intellectual
disability (intellectual developmental disorder) or visual impair-
ment and are not attributable to a neurological condition affecting
movement (e.g., cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, degenera-
tive disorder).

40 Neurodevelopmental Disorders
Stereotypic Movement Disorder
307.3 (F98.4)
A. Repetitive, seemingly driven, and apparently purposeless motor
behavior (e.g., hand shaking or waving, body rocking, head bang-
ing, self-biting, hitting own body).
B. The repetitive motor behavior interferes with social, academic, or
other activities and may result in self-injury.
C. Onset is in the early developmental period.
D. The repetitive motor behavior is not attributable to the physiolog-
ical effects of a substance or neurological condition and is not
better explained by another neurodevelopmental or mental
disorder (e.g., trichotillomania [hair-pulling disorder], obsessive-
compulsive disorder).
Specify if:
With self-injurious behavior (or behavior that would result in an
injury if preventive measures were not used).
Without self-injurious behavior
Specify if:
Associated with a known medical or genetic condition, neu-
rodevelopmental disorder, or environmental factor (e.g.,
Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, intellectual disability [intellectual devel-
opmental disorder], intrauterine alcohol exposure).
Coding note: Use additional code to identify the associated
medical or genetic condition, or neurodevelopmental disorder.
Specify current severity:
Mild: Symptoms are easily suppressed by sensory stimulus or
distraction.
Moderate: Symptoms require explicit protective measures and
behavioral modification.
Severe: Continuous monitoring and protective measures are re-
quired to prevent serious injury.

Tic Disorders 41
Recording Procedures
For stereotypic movement disorder that is associated with a known
medical or genetic condition, neurodevelopmental disorder, or envi-
ronmental factor, record stereotypic movement disorder associated
with (name of condition, disorder, or factor) (e.g., stereotypic move-
ment disorder associated with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome).
Tic Disorders
Note: A tic is a sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor move-
ment or vocalization.
Tourette’s Disorder 307.23 (F95.2)
A. Both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics have been pres-
ent at some time during the illness, although not necessarily con-
currently.
B. The tics may wax and wane in frequency but have persisted for
more than 1 year since first tic onset.
C. Onset is before age 18 years.
D. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of
a substance (e.g., cocaine) or another medical condition (e.g.,
Huntington’s disease, postviral encephalitis).
Persistent (Chronic) Motor or
Vocal Tic Disorder 307.22 (F95.1)
A. Single or multiple motor or vocal tics have been present during
the illness, but not both motor and vocal.
B. The tics may wax and wane in frequency but have persisted for
more than 1 year since first tic onset.
C. Onset is before age 18 years.
D. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of
a substance (e.g., cocaine) or another medical condition (e.g.,
Huntington’s disease, postviral encephalitis).
E. Criteria have never been met for Tourette’s disorder.
Specify if:
With motor tics only
With vocal tics only

42 Neurodevelopmental Disorders
Provisional Tic Disorder 307.21 (F95.0)
A. Single or multiple motor and/or vocal tics.
B. The tics have been present for less than 1 year since first tic
onset.
C. Onset is before age 18 years.
D. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of
a substance (e.g., cocaine) or another medical condition (e.g.,
Huntington’s disease, postviral encephalitis).
E. Criteria have never been met for Tourette’s disorder or persistent
(chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder.
Other Specified Tic Disorder
307.20 (F95.8)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a tic disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impair-
ment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning
predominate but do not meet the full criteria for a tic disorder or any
of the disorders in the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic
class. The other specified tic disorder category is used in situations
in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason
that the presentation does not meet the criteria for a tic disorder or
any specific neurodevelopmental disorder. This is done by recording
“other specified tic disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g.,
“with onset after age 18 years”).
Unspecified Tic Disorder
307.20 (F95.9)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a tic disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impair-
ment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning
predominate but do not meet the full criteria for a tic disorder or for
any of the disorders in the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic
class. The unspecified tic disorder category is used in situations in

Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder 43
which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria
are not met for a tic disorder or for a specific neurodevelopmental dis-
order, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient infor-
mation to make a more specific diagnosis.
Other Neurodevelopmental
Disorders
Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder
315.8 (F88)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms charac-
teristic of a neurodevelopmental disorder that cause impairment in so-
cial, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate
but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the neurode-
velopmental disorders diagnostic class. The other specified neuro-
developmental disorder category is used in situations in which the
clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presen-
tation does not meet the criteria for any specific neurodevelopmental
disorder. This is done by recording “other specified neurodevelopmen-
tal disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “neurodevelopmen-
tal disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure”).
An example of a presentation that can be specified using the
“other specified” designation is the following:
Neurodevelopmental disorder associated with prenatal al-
cohol exposure: Neurodevelopmental disorder associated with
prenatal alcohol exposure is characterized by a range of devel-
opmental disabilities following exposure to alcohol in utero.

44 Neurodevelopmental Disorders
Unspecified Neurodevelopmental Disorder
315.9 (F89)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms charac-
teristic of a neurodevelopmental disorder that cause impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predom-
inate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the
neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified
neurodevelopmental disorder category is used in situations in which
the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not
met for a specific neurodevelopmental disorder, and includes pre-
sentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more
specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

Schizophrenia Spectrum and
Other Psychotic Disorders
Schizotypal (Personality) Disorder
Criteria for schizotypal personality disorder can be found in the
chapter “Personality Disorders.” Because this disorder is considered
part of the schizophrenia spectrum of disorders, and is labeled in this
section of ICD-9 and ICD-10 as schizotypal disorder, it is listed in this
chapter, and the criteria are presented in the chapter “Personality
Disorders.”
Delusional Disorder
297.1 (F22)
A. The presence of one (or more) delusions with a duration of 1 month
or longer.
B. Criterion A for schizophrenia has never been met.
Note: Hallucinations, if present, are not prominent and are related
to the delusional theme (e.g., the sensation of being infested with
insects associated with delusions of infestation).
C. Apart from the impact of the delusion(s) or its ramifications, func-
tioning is not markedly impaired, and behavior is not obviously bi-
zarre or odd.
D. If manic or major depressive episodes have occurred, these have
been brief relative to the duration of the delusional periods.
E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of
a substance or another medical condition and is not better ex-
plained by another mental disorder, such as body dysmorphic
disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Specify whether:
Erotomanic type: This subtype applies when the central theme of
the delusion is that another person is in love with the individual.
45

46 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders
Grandiose type: This subtype applies when the central theme of
the delusion is the conviction of having some great (but unrecog-
nized) talent or insight or having made some important discovery.
Jealous type: This subtype applies when the central theme of the
individual’s delusion is that his or her spouse or lover is unfaithful.
Persecutory type: This subtype applies when the central theme
of the delusion involves the individual’s belief that he or she is be-
ing conspired against, cheated, spied on, followed, poisoned or
drugged, maliciously maligned, harassed, or obstructed in the
pursuit of long-term goals.
Somatic type: This subtype applies when the central theme of
the delusion involves bodily functions or sensations.
Mixed type: This subtype applies when no one delusional theme
predominates.
Unspecified type: This subtype applies when the dominant de-
lusional belief cannot be clearly determined or is not described in
the specific types (e.g., referential delusions without a prominent
persecutory or grandiose component).
Specify if:
With bizarre content: Delusions are deemed bizarre if they are
clearly implausible, not understandable, and not derived from or-
dinary life experiences (e.g., an individual’s belief that a stranger
has removed his or her internal organs and replaced them with
someone else’s organs without leaving any wounds or scars).
Specify if:
The following course specifiers are only to be used after a 1-year du-
ration of the disorder:
First episode, currently in acute episode: First manifestation
of the disorder meeting the defining diagnostic symptom and
time criteria. An acute episode is a time period in which the
symptom criteria are fulfilled.
First episode, currently in partial remission: Partial remission
is a time period during which an improvement after a previous
episode is maintained and in which the defining criteria of the dis-
order are only partially fulfilled.

Brief Psychotic Disorder 47
First episode, currently in full remission: Full remission is a
period of time after a previous episode during which no disorder-
specific symptoms are present.
Multiple episodes, currently in acute episode
Multiple episodes, currently in partial remission
Multiple episodes, currently in full remission
Continuous: Symptoms fulfilling the diagnostic symptom criteria
of the disorder are remaining for the majority of the illness
course, with subthreshold symptom periods being very brief rel-
ative to the overall course.
Unspecified
Specify current severity:
Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary
symptoms of psychosis, including delusions, hallucinations, disor-
ganized speech, abnormal psychomotor behavior, and negative
symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be rated for its current
severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging
from 0 (not present) to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician-
Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity in the chapter
“Assessment Measures” in Section III of DSM-5.)
Note: Diagnosis of delusional disorder can be made without us-
ing this severity specifier.
Brief Psychotic Disorder
298.8 (F23)
A. Presence of one (or more) of the following symptoms. At least
one of these must be (1), (2), or (3):
1. Delusions.
2. Hallucinations.
3. Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoher-
ence).
4. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior.
Note: Do not include a symptom if it is a culturally sanctioned re-
sponse.

48 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders
B. Duration of an episode of the disturbance is at least 1 day but
less than 1 month, with eventual full return to premorbid level of
functioning.
C. The disturbance is not better explained by major depressive or
bipolar disorder with psychotic features or another psychotic dis-
order such as schizophrenia or catatonia, and is not attributable
to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse,
a medication) or another medical condition.
Specify if:
With marked stressor(s) (brief reactive psychosis): If symp-
toms occur in response to events that, singly or together, would
be markedly stressful to almost anyone in similar circumstances
in the individual’s culture.
Without marked stressor(s): If symptoms do not occur in re-
sponse to events that, singly or together, would be markedly
stressful to almost anyone in similar circumstances in the individ-
ual’s culture.
With postpartum onset: If onset is during pregnancy or within 4
weeks postpartum.
Specify if:
With catatonia (refer to the criteria for catatonia associated with
another mental disorder, pp. 60–61, for definition).
Coding note: Use additional code 293.89 (F06.1) catatonia
associated with brief psychotic disorder to indicate the pres-
ence of the comorbid catatonia.
Specify current severity:
Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary
symptoms of psychosis, including delusions, hallucinations, disor-
ganized speech, abnormal psychomotor behavior, and negative
symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be rated for its current
severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging
from 0 (not present) to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician-
Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity in the chapter
“Assessment Measures” in Section III of DSM-5.)
Note: Diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder can be made without
using this severity specifier.

Schizophreniform Disorder 49
Schizophreniform Disorder
295.40 (F20.81)
A. Two (or more) of the following, each present for a significant por-
tion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully
treated). At least one of these must be (1), (2), or (3):
1. Delusions.
2. Hallucinations.
3. Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoher-
ence).
4. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior.
5. Negative symptoms (i.e., diminished emotional expression
or avolition).
B. An episode of the disorder lasts at least 1 month but less than
6 months. When the diagnosis must be made without waiting
for recovery, it should be qualified as “provisional.”
C. Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with
psychotic features have been ruled out because either 1) no
major depressive or manic episodes have occurred concurrently
with the active-phase symptoms, or 2) if mood episodes have oc-
curred during active-phase symptoms, they have been present
for a minority of the total duration of the active and residual peri-
ods of the illness.
D. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of
a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another med-
ical condition.
Specify if:
With good prognostic features: This specifier requires the
presence of at least two of the following features: onset of prom-
inent psychotic symptoms within 4 weeks of the first noticeable
change in usual behavior or functioning; confusion or perplexity;
good premorbid social and occupational functioning; and ab-
sence of blunted or flat affect.
Without good prognostic features: This specifier is applied if
two or more of the above features have not been present.

presence of the comorbid catatonia.
Specify current severity:
Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary
symptoms of psychosis, including delusions, hallucinations, disor-
ganized speech, abnormal psychomotor behavior, and negative
symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be rated for its current
severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging
from 0 (not present) to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician-
Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity in the chapter
“Assessment Measures” in Section III of DSM-5.)

A. Two (or more) of the following, each present for a significant por-
tion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully
treated). At least one of these must be (1), (2), or (3):
1. Delusions.
2. Hallucinations.
3. Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoher-
ence).
4. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior.
5. Negative symptoms (i.e., diminished emotional expression
or avolition).
B. For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the distur-
bance, level of functioning in one or more major areas, such as
work, interpersonal relations, or self-care, is markedly below the
level achieved prior to the onset (or when the onset is in child-

Schizophrenia 51
hood or adolescence, there is failure to achieve expected level of
interpersonal, academic, or occupational functioning).
C. Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 months.
This 6-month period must include at least 1 month of symptoms
(or less if successfully treated) that meet Criterion A (i.e., active-
phase symptoms) and may include periods of prodromal or re-
sidual symptoms. During these prodromal or residual periods,
the signs of the disturbance may be manifested by only negative
symptoms or by two or more symptoms listed in Criterion A pres-
ent in an attenuated form (e.g., odd beliefs, unusual perceptual
experiences).
D. Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with
psychotic features have been ruled out because either 1) no ma-
jor depressive or manic episodes have occurred concurrently
with the active-phase symptoms, or 2) if mood episodes have
occurred during active-phase symptoms, they have been present
for a minority of the total duration of the active and residual peri-
ods of the illness.
E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of
a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another med-
ical condition.
F. If there is a history of autism spectrum disorder or a communica-
tion disorder of childhood onset, the additional diagnosis of
schizophrenia is made only if prominent delusions or hallucina-
tions, in addition to the other required symptoms of schizophre-
nia, are also present for at least 1 month (or less if successfully
treated).

Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder 55
Substance/Medication-Induced
Psychotic Disorder
A. Presence of one or both of the following symptoms:
1. Delusions.
2. Hallucinations.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or lab-
oratory findings of both (1) and (2):
1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after
substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a
medication.
2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing
the symptoms in Criterion A.
C. The disturbance is not better explained by a psychotic disorder
that is not substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an
independent psychotic disorder could include the following:
The symptoms preceded the onset of the substance/medica-
tion use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of
time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute with-
drawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence of an
independent non-substance/medication-induced psychotic
disorder (e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance/medica-
tion-related episodes).
D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of
a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
Note: This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of sub-
stance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms
in Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and when they are
sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific
substance/medication]-induced psychotic disorders are indicated in
the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether
or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the

56 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders
same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comor-
bid with the substance-induced psychotic disorder, the 4th position
character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use
disorder” before the substance-induced psychotic disorder (e.g.,
“mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced psychotic disorder”).
If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the
substance-induced psychotic disorder, the 4th position character is
“2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disor-
der” or “severe [substance] use disorder” depending on the severity
of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid sub-
stance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance),
then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record
only the substance-induced psychotic disorder.

Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder 57
Specify if (see Table 1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addic-
tive Disorders” for diagnoses associated with substance class):
With onset during intoxication: If the criteria are met for intox-
ication with the substance and the symptoms develop during in-
toxication.
With onset during withdrawal: If the criteria are met for with-
drawal from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or
shortly after, withdrawal.
Specify current severity:
Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary
symptoms of psychosis, including delusions, hallucinations, ab-
normal psychomotor behavior, and negative symptoms. Each of
these symptoms may be rated for its current severity (most se-
vere in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not
present) to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician-Rated Dimen-
sions of Psychosis Symptom Severity in the chapter “Assess-
ment Measures” in Section III of DSM-5.)
Note: Diagnosis of substance/medication-induced psychotic dis-
order can be made without using this severity specifier.
Recording Procedures
ICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced psy-
chotic disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexa-
methasone) that is presumed to be causing the delusions or
hallucinations. The diagnostic code is selected from the table in-
cluded in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For sub-
stances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone),
the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which
a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class
of substance is unknown, the category “unknown substance” should
be used.
The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset
(i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal). Unlike the
recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the substance-
induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single code, for
ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use

58 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders
disorder. For example, in the case of delusions occurring during in-
toxication in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis
is 292.9 cocaine-induced psychotic disorder, with onset during intox-
ication. An additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe cocaine use disorder
is also given. When more than one substance is judged to play a sig-
nificant role in the development of psychotic symptoms, each should
be listed separately (e.g., 292.9 cannabis-induced psychotic disorder
with onset during intoxication, with severe cannabis use disorder;
292.9 phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder, with onset during
intoxication, with mild phencyclidine use disorder).
ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced psy-
chotic disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine,
dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the delusions or hal-
lucinations. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included
in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or
absence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For substances that do
not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for
“other substance” with no comorbid substance use should be used;
and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor
but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “un-
known substance” with no comorbid substance use should be used.
When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid sub-
stance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word “with,”
followed by the name of the substance-induced psychotic disorder,
followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication,
onset during withdrawal). For example, in the case of delusions oc-
curring during intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine use disor-
der, the diagnosis is F14.259 severe cocaine use disorder with cocaine-
induced psychotic disorder, with onset during intoxication. A sepa-
rate diagnosis of the comorbid severe cocaine use disorder is not given.
If the substance-induced psychotic disorder occurs without a comor-
bid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the
substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g.,
F16.959 phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder, with onset dur-
ing intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a
significant role in the development of psychotic symptoms, each
should be listed separately (e.g., F12.259 severe cannabis use disorder
with cannabis-induced psychotic disorder, with onset during intoxi-

Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition 59
cation; F16.159 mild phencyclidine use disorder with phencyclidine-
induced psychotic disorder, with onset during intoxication).
Psychotic Disorder
Due to Another Medical Condition
A. Prominent hallucinations or delusions.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or lab-
oratory findings that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiolog-
ical consequence of another medical condition.
C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder.
D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of
a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
Specify whether:
Code based on predominant symptom:
293.81 (F06.2) With delusions: If delusions are the predomi-
nant symptom.
293.82 (F06.0) With hallucinations: If hallucinations are the
predominant symptom.
Coding note: Include the name of the other medical condition in the
name of the mental disorder (e.g., 293.81 [F06.2] psychotic disorder
due to malignant lung neoplasm, with delusions). The other medical
condition should be coded and listed separately immediately before
the psychotic disorder due to the medical condition (e.g., 162.9
[C34.90] malignant lung neoplasm; 293.81 [F06.2] psychotic disorder
due to malignant lung neoplasm, with delusions).
Specify current severity:
Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary
symptoms of psychosis, including delusions, hallucinations, ab-
normal psychomotor behavior, and negative symptoms. Each of
these symptoms may be rated for its current severity (most severe
in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not present)
to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psy-

60 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders

when recording the name of the condition (e.g., 293.89 [F06.1] catatonia
associated with major depressive disorder). Code first the associated
mental disorder (i.e., neurodevelopmental disorder, brief psychotic dis-
order, schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disor-
der, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, or other mental
disorder) (e.g., 295.70 [F25.1] schizoaffective disorder, depressive type;

and listed separately immediately before the catatonic disorder due to
the medical condition (e.g., 572.2 [K71.90] hepatic encephalopathy;
293.89 [F06.1] catatonic disorder due to hepatic encephalopathy).
Unspecified Catatonia
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of catatonia cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning but either
the nature of the underlying mental disorder or other medical con-
dition is unclear, full criteria for catatonia are not met, or there is
insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in
emergency room settings).
Coding note: Code first 781.99 (R29.818) other symptoms involving
nervous and musculoskeletal systems, followed by 293.89 (F06.1)
unspecified catatonia.

Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder 63
Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and
Other Psychotic Disorder
298.8 (F28)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder that
cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not
meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the schizophrenia
spectrum and other psychotic disorders diagnostic class. The other
specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder cate-
gory is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communi-
cate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the
criteria for any specific schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic
disorder. This is done by recording “other specified schizophrenia
spectrum and other psychotic disorder” followed by the specific rea-
son (e.g., “persistent auditory hallucinations”).
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other
specified” designation include the following:
1. Persistent auditory hallucinations occurring in the absence of
any other features.
2. Delusions with significant overlapping mood episodes: This
includes persistent delusions with periods of overlapping mood
episodes that are present for a substantial portion of the delu-
sional disturbance (such that the criterion stipulating only brief
mood disturbance in delusional disorder is not met).
3. Attenuated psychosis syndrome: This syndrome is character-
ized by psychotic-like symptoms that are below a threshold for
full psychosis (e.g., the symptoms are less severe and more tran-
sient, and insight is relatively maintained).
4. Delusional symptoms in partner of individual with delusional
disorder: In the context of a relationship, the delusional material
from the dominant partner provides content for delusional belief by
the individual who may not otherwise entirely meet criteria for de-
lusional disorder.

64 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders
Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and
Other Psychotic Disorder
298.9 (F29)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder that
cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not
meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the schizophrenia spec-
trum and other psychotic disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified
schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder category is
used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the rea-
son that the criteria are not met for a specific schizophrenia spectrum
and other psychotic disorder, and includes presentations in which
there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis
(e.g., in emergency room settings).

Bipolar and
Related Disorders
Bipolar I Disorder
For a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, it is necessary to meet the fol-
lowing criteria for a manic episode. The manic episode may have
been preceded by and may be followed by hypomanic or major de-
pressive episodes.
Manic Episode
A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expan-
sive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased
activity or energy. lasting at least 1 week and present most
of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospitalization
is necessary).
B. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or
activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood
is only irritable) are present to a significant degree and represent
a noticeable change from usual behavior:
1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.
2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours
of sleep).
3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.
4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.
5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant
or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed.
6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or
school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation (i.e., purpose-
less non-goal-directed activity).
7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for
painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying
sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments).
65

66 Bipolar and Related Disorders
C. The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked im-
pairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate
hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others, or there are psy-
chotic features.
D. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment)
or to another medical condition.
Note: A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant
treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but per-
sists at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect
of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a manic episode and,
therefore, a bipolar I diagnosis.
Note: Criteria A–D constitute a manic episode. At least one lifetime
manic episode is required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.
Hypomanic Episode
A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expan-
sive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased
activity or energy, lasting at least 4 consecutive days and present
most of the day, nearly every day.
B. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy
and activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if
the mood is only irritable) have persisted, represent a noticeable
change from usual behavior, and have been present to a signifi-
cant degree:
1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.
2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours
of sleep).
3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.
4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.
5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant
or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed.
6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or
school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation.
7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential
for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained

Bipolar I Disorder 67
buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business in-
vestments).
C. The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in func-
tioning that is uncharacteristic of the individual when not symp-
tomatic.
D. The disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are ob-
servable by others.
E. The episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment
in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitaliza-
tion. If there are psychotic features, the episode is, by definition,
manic.
F. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment).
Note: A full hypomanic episode that emerges during antidepres-
sant treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but
persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect
of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a hypomanic episode
diagnosis. However, caution is indicated so that one or two
symptoms (particularly increased irritability, edginess, or agita-
tion following antidepressant use) are not taken as sufficient for
diagnosis of a hypomanic episode, nor necessarily indicative of
a bipolar diathesis.
Note: Criteria A–F constitute a hypomanic episode. Hypomanic epi-
sodes are common in bipolar I disorder but are not required for the
diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.
Major Depressive Episode
A. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present
during the same 2-week period and represent a change from pre-
vious functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) de-
pressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.
Note: Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to
another medical condition.
1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indi-
cated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, or
hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tear-
ful). (Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.)

68 Bipolar and Related Disorders
2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all,
activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by
either subjective account or observation).
3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g.,
a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or de-
crease or increase in appetite nearly every day. (Note: In
children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)
4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.
5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (ob-
servable by others; not merely subjective feelings of rest-
lessness or being slowed down).
6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.
7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt
(which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-
reproach or guilt about being sick).
8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness,
nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed
by others).
9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent
suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt
or a specific plan for committing suicide.
B. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
C. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance or another medical condition.
Note: Criteria A–C constitute a major depressive episode. Major de-
pressive episodes are common in bipolar I disorder but are not re-
quired for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.
Note: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial
ruin, losses from a natural disaster, a serious medical illness or dis-
ability) may include the feelings of intense sadness, rumination about
the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Criterion A,
which may resemble a depressive episode. Although such symptoms
may be understandable or considered appropriate to the loss, the
presence of a major depressive episode in addition to the normal re-

Bipolar I Disorder 69
sponse to a significant loss should also be carefully considered. This
decision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical judgment based
on the individual’s history and the cultural norms for the expression
of distress in the context of loss.1
Bipolar I Disorder
A. Criteria have been met for at least one manic episode (Criteria
A–D under “Manic Episode” above).
B. The occurrence of the manic and major depressive episode(s) is
not better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia,
schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other speci-
fied or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic
disorder.
1In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is useful to
consider that in grief the predominant affect is feelings of emptiness and loss,
while in an MDE, it is persistent depressed mood and the inability to anticipate
happiness or pleasure. The dysphoria in grief is likely to decrease in intensity
over days to weeks and occurs in waves, the so-called pangs of grief. These
waves tend to be associated with thoughts or reminders of the deceased. The
depressed mood of an MDE is more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts
or preoccupations. The pain of grief may be accompanied by positive emotions
and humor that are uncharacteristic of the pervasive unhappiness and misery
characteristic of an MDE. The thought content associated with grief generally
features a preoccupation with thoughts and memories of the deceased, rather
than the self-critical or pessimistic ruminations seen in an MDE. In grief, self-
esteem is generally preserved, whereas in an MDE, feelings of worthlessness
and self-loathing are common. If self-derogatory ideation is present in grief, it
typically involves perceived failings vis-à-vis the deceased (e.g., not visiting
frequently enough, not telling the deceased how much he or she was loved). If
a bereaved individual thinks about death and dying, such thoughts are gener-
ally focused on the deceased and possibly about “joining” the deceased,
whereas in an MDE, such thoughts are focused on ending one’s own life be-
cause of feeling worthless, undeserving of life, or unable to cope with the pain
of depression.

Coding and Recording Procedures
The diagnostic code for bipolar I disorder is based on type of current
or most recent episode and its status with respect to current severity,
presence of psychotic features, and remission status. Current severity
and psychotic features are only indicated if full criteria are currently met
for a manic or major depressive episode. Remission specifiers are only
indicated if the full criteria are not currently met for a manic, hypo-
manic, or major depressive episode. Codes are as follows:

In recording the name of a diagnosis, terms should be listed in the fol-
lowing order: bipolar I disorder, type of current or most recent episode,
severity/psychotic/remission specifiers, followed by as many specifi-
ers without codes as apply to the current or most recent episode.

Bipolar II Disorder
296.89 (F31.81)
For a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder, it is necessary to meet the following
criteria for a current or past hypomanic episode and the following criteria
for a current or past major depressive episode:
Hypomanic Episode
A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expan-
sive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased
activity or energy, lasting at least 4 consecutive days and present
most of the day, nearly every day.
B. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy and
activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms have persisted
(four if the mood is only irritable), represent a noticeable change
from usual behavior, and have been present to a significant degree:

72 Bipolar and Related Disorders
1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.
2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours
of sleep).
3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.
4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.
5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant
or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed.
6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or
school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation.
7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for
painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying
sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments).
C. The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in func-
tioning that is uncharacteristic of the individual when not symp-
tomatic.
D. The disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are ob-
servable by others.
E. The episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in
social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization.
If there are psychotic features, the episode is, by definition, manic.
F. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a sub-
stance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication or other treatment).
Note: A full hypomanic episode that emerges during antidepressant
treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists
at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect of that
treatment is sufficient evidence for a hypomanic episode diagnosis.
However, caution is indicated so that one or two symptoms (partic-
ularly increased irritability, edginess, or agitation following anti-
depressant use) are not taken as sufficient for diagnosis of a
hypomanic episode, nor necessarily indicative of a bipolar diathesis.
Major Depressive Episode
A. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present
during the same 2-week period and represent a change from pre-
vious functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) de-
pressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.

Bipolar II Disorder 73
Note: Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to a
medical condition.
1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indi-
cated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, or
hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tear-
ful). (Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.)
2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all,
activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by
either subjective account or observation).
3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g.,
a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or de-
crease or increase in appetite nearly every day. (Note: In
children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)
4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.
5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (ob-
servable by others; not merely subjective feelings of rest-
lessness or being slowed down).
6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.
7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt
(which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-
reproach or guilt about being sick).
8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness,
nearly every day (either by subjective account or as ob-
served by others).
9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent
suicidal ideation without a specific plan, a suicide attempt, or
a specific plan for committing suicide.
B. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
C. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance or another medical condition.
Note: Criteria A–C above constitute a major depressive episode.
Note: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial
ruin, losses from a natural disaster, a serious medical illness or dis-
ability) may include the feelings of intense sadness, rumination about

74 Bipolar and Related Disorders
the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Criterion A,
which may resemble a depressive episode. Although such symptoms
may be understandable or considered appropriate to the loss, the
presence of a major depressive episode in addition to the normal re-
sponse to a significant loss should be carefully considered. This de-
cision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical judgment based on
the individual’s history and the cultural norms for the expression of
distress in the context of loss.2
Bipolar II Disorder
A. Criteria have been met for at least one hypomanic episode (Cri-
teria A–F under “Hypomanic Episode” above) and at least one
major depressive episode (Criteria A–C under “Major Depressive
Episode” above).
B. There has never been a manic episode.
C. The occurrence of the hypomanic episode(s) and major depres-
sive episode(s) is not better explained by schizoaffective disorder,
schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or
other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other
psychotic disorder.
2In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is useful to
consider that in grief the predominant affect is feelings of emptiness and loss,
while in an MDE, it is persistent depressed mood and the inability to anticipate
happiness or pleasure. The dysphoria in grief is likely to decrease in intensity
over days to weeks and occurs in waves, the so-called pangs of grief. These
waves tend to be associated with thoughts or reminders of the deceased. The de-
pressed mood of an MDE is more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or
preoccupations. The pain of grief may be accompanied by positive emotions and
humor that are uncharacteristic of the pervasive unhappiness and misery char-
acteristic of an MDE. The thought content associated with grief generally fea-
tures a preoccupation with thoughts and memories of the deceased, rather than

the deceased and possibly about “joining” the deceased, whereas in an MDE,
such thoughts are focused on ending one’s own life because of feeling worthless,
undeserving of life, or unable to cope with the pain of depression.

Bipolar II Disorder 75
D. The symptoms of depression or the unpredictability caused by
frequent alternation between periods of depression and hypoma-
nia causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
Coding and Recording Procedures
Bipolar II disorder has one diagnostic code: 296.89 (F31.81). Its status
with respect to current severity, presence of psychotic features,
course, and other specifiers cannot be coded but should be indicated
in writing (e.g., 296.89 [F31.81] bipolar II disorder, current episode de-
pressed, moderate severity, with mixed features; 296.89 [F31.81] bi-
polar II disorder, most recent episode depressed, in partial remission).
Specify current or most recent episode:
Hypomanic
Depressed
Specify if:
With anxious distress (pp. 83–84)
With mixed features (pp. 84–86)
With rapid cycling (p. 86)
With mood-congruent psychotic features (pp. 88–89)
With mood-incongruent psychotic features (pp. 88–89)
With catatonia (p. 89). Coding note: Use additional code
293.89 (F06.1).
With peripartum onset (pp. 89–90)
With seasonal pattern (pp. 90–92): Applies only to the pattern
of major depressive episodes.
Specify course if full criteria for a mood episode are not currently met:
In partial remission (p. 92)
In full remission (p. 92)
Specify severity if full criteria for a mood episode are currently met:
Mild (p. 92)
Moderate (p. 92)
Severe (p. 92)

76 Bipolar and Related Disorders
Cyclothymic Disorder
301.13 (F34.0)
A. For at least 2 years (at least 1 year in children and adolescents)
there have been numerous periods with hypomanic symptoms
that do not meet criteria for a hypomanic episode and numerous
periods with depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for a
major depressive episode.
B. During the above 2-year period (1 year in children and adoles-
cents), the hypomanic and depressive periods have been pres-
ent for at least half the time and the individual has not been
without the symptoms for more than 2 months at a time.
C. Criteria for a major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode have
never been met.
D. The symptoms in Criterion A are not better explained by schizo-
affective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, de-
lusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia
spectrum and other psychotic disorder.
E. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of
a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another med-
ical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism).
F. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
Specify if:
With anxious distress (see pp. 83–84)
Substance/Medication-Induced
Bipolar and Related Disorder
A. A prominent and persistent disturbance in mood that predominates
in the clinical picture and is characterized by elevated, expansive, or
irritable mood, with or without depressed mood, or markedly dimin-
ished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.

Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder 77
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or lab-
oratory findings of both (1) and (2):
1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after
substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a
medication.
2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing
the symptoms in Criterion A.
C. The disturbance is not better explained by a bipolar or related disor-
der that is not substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an
independent bipolar or related disorder could include the following:
The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medica-
tion use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time
(e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute withdrawal
or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting
the existence of an independent non-substance/medication-
induced bipolar and related disorder (e.g., a history of recur-
rent non-substance/medication-related episodes).
D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of
a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific
substance/medication]-induced bipolar and related disorders are in-
dicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends
on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder pres-
ent for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder
is comorbid with the substance-induced bipolar and related disorder,
the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild
[substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced bipolar and
related disorder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-
induced bipolar and related disorder”). If a moderate or severe sub-
stance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced bipolar
and related disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clini-
cian should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe
[substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid

78 Bipolar and Related Disorders
substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disor-
der (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th
position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the sub-
stance-induced bipolar and related disorder.

Specify if (see Table 1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addic-
tive Disorders” for diagnoses associated with substance class):
With onset during intoxication: If the criteria are met for intox-
ication with the substance and the symptoms develop during in-
toxication.
With onset during withdrawal: If criteria are met for withdrawal
from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly
after, withdrawal.

Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder 79
Recording Procedures
ICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced bipolar
and related disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine,
dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the bipolar mood
symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in
the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do
not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for “other
substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged
to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is un-
known, the category “unknown substance” should be used.
The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset
(i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal). Unlike the
recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the substance-
induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single code, for
ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use
disorder. For example, in the case of irritable symptoms occurring
during intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the
diagnosis is 292.84 cocaine-induced bipolar and related disorder, with
onset during intoxication. An additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe
cocaine use disorder is also given. When more than one substance is
judged to play a significant role in the development of bipolar mood
symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., 292.84 methylphe-
nidate-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during in-
toxication; 292.84 dexamethasone-induced bipolar and related disor-
der, with onset during intoxication).
ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced bipo-
lar and related disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., co-
caine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the bipolar
mood symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table in-
cluded in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence
or absence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For substances that
do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for
“other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is
judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is
unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used.
When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid sub-
stance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word
“with,” followed by the name of the substance-induced bipolar and

80 Bipolar and Related Disorders
related disorder, followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset
during intoxication, onset during withdrawal). For example, in the
case of irritable symptoms occurring during intoxication in a man
with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is F14.24 severe co-
caine use disorder with cocaine-induced bipolar and related disorder,
with onset during intoxication. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid
severe cocaine use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced bi-
polar and related disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use
disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accom-
panying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F15.94 amphetamine-
induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during intoxica-
tion). When more than one substance is judged to play a significant
role in the development of bipolar mood symptoms, each should be
listed separately (e.g., F15.24 severe methylphenidate use disorder
with methylphenidate-induced bipolar and related disorder, with
onset during intoxication; F19.94 dexamethasone-induced bipolar
and related disorder, with onset during intoxication).
Bipolar and Related Disorder
Due to Another Medical Condition
A. A prominent and persistent period of abnormally elevated, ex-
pansive, or irritable mood and abnormally increased activity or
energy that predominates in the clinical picture.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or lab-
oratory findings that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiolog-
ical consequence of another medical condition.
C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder.
D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of
a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impair-
ment in social, occupational, or other important areas of function-
ing, or necessitates hospitalization to prevent harm to self or
others, or there are psychotic features.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code for bipolar and related disorder
due to another medical condition is 293.83, which is assigned regard-

Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder 81
less of the specifier. The ICD-10-CM code depends on the specifier
(see below).
Specify if:
(F06.33) With manic features: Full criteria are not met for a
manic or hypomanic episode.
(F06.33) With manic- or hypomanic-like episode: Full criteria
are met except Criterion D for a manic episode or except Crite-
rion F for a hypomanic episode.
(F06.34) With mixed features: Symptoms of depression are
also present but do not predominate in the clinical picture.
Coding note: Include the name of the other medical condition in the
name of the mental disorder (e.g., 293.83 [F06.33] bipolar disorder
due to hyperthyroidism, with manic features). The other medical con-
dition should also be coded and listed separately immediately before
the bipolar and related disorder due to the medical condition (e.g.,
242.90 [E05.90] hyperthyroidism; 293.83 [F06.33] bipolar disorder
due to hyperthyroidism, with manic features).
Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder
296.89 (F31.89)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a bipolar and related disorder that cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important ar-
eas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any
of the disorders in the bipolar and related disorders diagnostic class.
The other specified bipolar and related disorder category is used in
situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific
reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any spe-
cific bipolar and related disorder. This is done by recording “other
specified bipolar and related disorder” followed by the specific reason
(e.g., “short-duration cyclothymia”).
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other
specified” designation include the following:

82 Bipolar and Related Disorders
1. Short-duration hypomanic episodes (2–3 days) and major
depressive episodes: A lifetime history of one or more major
depressive episodes in individuals whose presentation has never
met full criteria for a manic or hypomanic episode but who have
experienced two or more episodes of short-duration hypomania
that meet the full symptomatic criteria for a hypomanic episode
but that only last for 2–3 days. The episodes of hypomanic symp-
toms do not overlap in time with the major depressive episodes,
so the disturbance does not meet criteria for major depressive
episode, with mixed features.
2. Hypomanic episodes with insufficient symptoms and major
depressive episodes: A lifetime history of one or more major
depressive episodes in individuals whose presentation has never
met full criteria for a manic or hypomanic episode but who have
experienced one or more episodes of hypomania that do not
meet full symptomatic criteria (i.e., at least 4 consecutive days of
elevated mood and one or two of the other symptoms of a hypo-
manic episode, or irritable mood and two or three of the other
symptoms of a hypomanic episode). The episodes of hypomanic
symptoms do not overlap in time with the major depressive epi-
sodes, so the disturbance does not meet criteria for major de-
pressive episode, with mixed features.
3. Hypomanic episode without prior major depressive epi-
sode: One or more hypomanic episodes in an individual whose
presentation has never met full criteria for a major depressive ep-
isode or a manic episode. If this occurs in an individual with an
established diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder (dysthy-
mia), both diagnoses can be concurrently applied during the pe-
riods when the full criteria for a hypomanic episode are met.
4. Short-duration cyclothymia (less than 24 months): Multiple
episodes of hypomanic symptoms that do not meet criteria for a
hypomanic episode and multiple episodes of depressive symp-
toms that do not meet criteria for a major depressive episode that
persist over a period of less than 24 months (less than 12 months
for children or adolescents) in an individual whose presentation
has never met full criteria for a major depressive, manic, or hypo-

Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorder 83
manic episode and does not meet criteria for any psychotic dis-
order. During the course of the disorder, the hypomanic or depres-
sive symptoms are present for more days than not, the individual
has not been without symptoms for more than 2 months at a
time, and the symptoms cause clinically significant distress or im-
pairment.
Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorder
296.80 (F31.9)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a bipolar and related disorder that cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important ar-
eas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any
of the disorders in the bipolar and related disorders diagnostic class.
The unspecified bipolar and related disorder category is used in situ-
ations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the
criteria are not met for a specific bipolar and related disorder, and in-
cludes presentations in which there is insufficient information to
make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).
Specifiers for Bipolar and Related Disorders
Specify if:
With anxious distress: The presence of at least two of the fol-
lowing symptoms during the majority of days of the current or
most recent episode of mania, hypomania, or depression:
1. Feeling keyed up or tense.
2. Feeling unusually restless.
3. Difficulty concentrating because of worry.
4. Fear that something awful may happen.
5. Feeling that the individual might lose control of himself or
herself.

84 Bipolar and Related Disorders
Specify current severity:
Mild: Two symptoms.
Moderate: Three symptoms.
Moderate-severe: Four or five symptoms.
Severe: Four or five symptoms with motor agitation.
Note: Anxious distress has been noted as a prominent feature
of both bipolar and major depressive disorder in both primary
care and specialty mental health settings. High levels of anxi-
ety have been associated with higher suicide risk, longer
duration of illness, and greater likelihood of treatment non-
response. As a result, it is clinically useful to specify accurately
the presence and severity levels of anxious distress for treat-
ment planning and monitoring of response to treatment.
With mixed features: The mixed features specifier can apply to
the current manic, hypomanic, or depressive episode in bipolar I
or bipolar II disorder:
Manic or hypomanic episode, with mixed features:
A. Full criteria are met for a manic episode or hypomanic
episode, and at least three of the following symptoms
are present during the majority of days of the current or
most recent episode of mania or hypomania:
1. Prominent dysphoria or depressed mood as indicated
by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad or empty) or
observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful).
2. Diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all,
activities (as indicated by either subjective account
or observation made by others).
3. Psychomotor retardation nearly every day (observ-
able by others; not merely subjective feelings of be-
ing slowed down).
4. Fatigue or loss of energy.
5. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappro-
priate guilt (not merely self-reproach or guilt about
being sick).
6. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying),
recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or

Specifiers for Bipolar and Related Disorders 85
a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing
suicide.
B. Mixed symptoms are observable by others and repre-
sent a change from the person’s usual behavior.
C. For individuals whose symptoms meet full episode crite-
ria for both mania and depression simultaneously, the di-
agnosis should be manic episode, with mixed features,
due to the marked impairment and clinical severity of full
mania.
D. The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physio-
logical effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a
medication other treatment).
Depressive episode, with mixed features:
A. Full criteria are met for a major depressive episode, and
at least three of the following manic/hypomanic symp-
toms are present during the majority of days of the cur-
rent or most recent episode of depression:
1. Elevated, expansive mood.
2. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.
3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.
4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that
thoughts are racing.
5. Increase in energy or goal-directed activity (either
socially, at work or school, or sexually).
6. Increased or excessive involvement in activities that
have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g.,
engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual in-
discretions, or foolish business investments).
7. Decreased need for sleep (feeling rested despite
sleeping less than usual; to be contrasted with in-
somnia).
B. Mixed symptoms are observable by others and repre-
sent a change from the person’s usual behavior.
C. For individuals whose symptoms meet full episode crite-
ria for both mania and depression simultaneously, the di-
agnosis should be manic episode, with mixed features.

86 Bipolar and Related Disorders
D. The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physio-
logical effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a
medication or other treatment).
Note: Mixed features associated with a major depressive ep-
isode have been found to be a significant risk factor for the
development of bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. As a result,
it is clinically useful to note the presence of this specifier for
treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment.
With rapid cycling (can be applied to bipolar I or bipolar II dis-
order): Presence of at least four mood episodes in the previous
12 months that meet the criteria for manic, hypomanic, or major
depressive episode.
Note: Episodes are demarcated by either partial or full re-
missions of at least 2 months or a switch to an episode of the
opposite polarity (e.g., major depressive episode to manic
episode).
Note: The essential feature of a rapid-cycling bipolar disorder is
the occurrence of at least four mood episodes during the previ-
ous 12 months. These episodes can occur in any combination
and order. The episodes must meet both the duration and
symptom number criteria for a major depressive, manic, or hy-
pomanic episode and must be demarcated by either a period of
full remission or a switch to an episode of the opposite polarity.
Manic and hypomanic episodes are counted as being on the
same pole. Except for the fact that they occur more frequently,
the episodes that occur in a rapid-cycling pattern are no differ-
ent from those that occur in a non-rapid-cycling pattern. Mood
episodes that count toward defining a rapid-cycling pattern ex-
clude those episodes directly caused by a substance (e.g., co-
caine, corticosteroids) or another medical condition.
With melancholic features:
A. One of the following is present during the most severe period
of the current episode:
1. Loss of pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.
2. Lack of reactivity to usually pleasurable stimuli (does not
feel much better, even temporarily, when something
good happens).

Specifiers for Bipolar and Related Disorders 87
B. Three (or more) of the following:
1. A distinct quality of depressed mood characterized by
profound despondency, despair, and/or moroseness or
by so-called empty mood.
2. Depression that is regularly worse in the morning.
3. Early-morning awakening (i.e., at least 2 hours before
usual awakening).
4. Marked psychomotor agitation or retardation.
5. Significant anorexia or weight loss.
6. Excessive or inappropriate guilt.
Note: The specifier “with melancholic features” is applied if
these features are present at the most severe stage of the
episode. There is a near-complete absence of the capacity
for pleasure, not merely a diminution. A guideline for evalu-
ating the lack of reactivity of mood is that even highly desired
events are not associated with marked brightening of mood.
Either mood does not brighten at all, or it brightens only par-
tially (e.g., up to 20%–40% of normal for only minutes at a
time). The “distinct quality” of mood that is characteristic of
the “with melancholic features” specifier is experienced as
qualitatively different from that during a nonmelancholic de-
pressive episode. A depressed mood that is described as
merely more severe, longer lasting, or present without a rea-
son is not considered distinct in quality. Psychomotor chang-
es are nearly always present and are observable by others.
Melancholic features exhibit only a modest tendency to re-
peat across episodes in the same individual. They are more
frequent in inpatients, as opposed to outpatients; are less
likely to occur in milder than in more severe major depres-
sive episodes; and are more likely to occur in those with psy-
chotic features.
With atypical features: This specifier can be applied when
these features predominate during the majority of days of the
current or most recent major depressive episode.
A. Mood reactivity (i.e., mood brightens in response to actual or
potential positive events).
B. Two (or more) of the following features:

88 Bipolar and Related Disorders
1. Significant weight gain or increase in appetite.
2. Hypersomnia.
3. Leaden paralysis (i.e., heavy, leaden feelings in arms or
legs).
4. A long-standing pattern of interpersonal rejection sensi-
tivity (not limited to episodes of mood disturbance) that
results in significant social or occupational impairment.
C. Criteria are not met for “with melancholic features” or “with
catatonia” during the same episode.
Note: “Atypical depression” has historical significance (i.e.,
atypical in contradistinction to the more classical agitated,
“endogenous” presentations of depression that were the
norm when depression was rarely diagnosed in outpatients
and almost never in adolescents or younger adults) and to-
day does not connote an uncommon or unusual clinical pre-
sentation as the term might imply.
Mood reactivity is the capacity to be cheered up when pre-
sented with positive events (e.g., a visit from children, com-
pliments from others). Mood may become euthymic (not sad)
even for extended periods of time if the external circumstances
remain favorable. Increased appetite may be manifested by an
obvious increase in food intake or by weight gain. Hypersomnia
may include either an extended period of nighttime sleep or
daytime napping that totals at least 10 hours of sleep per day
(or at least 2 hours more than when not depressed). Leaden pa-
ralysis is defined as feeling heavy, leaden, or weighted down,
usually in the arms or legs. This sensation is generally present
for at least an hour a day but often lasts for many hours at a
time. Unlike the other atypical features, pathological sensitivity
to perceived interpersonal rejection is a trait that has an early
onset and persists throughout most of adult life. Rejection sen-
sitivity occurs both when the person is and is not depressed,
though it may be exacerbated during depressive periods.
With psychotic features: Delusions or hallucinations are pres-
ent at any time in the episode. If psychotic features are present,
specify if mood-congruent or mood-incongruent:

Specifiers for Bipolar and Related Disorders 89
With mood-congruent psychotic features: During
manic episodes, the content of all delusions and halluci-
nations is consistent with the typical manic themes of
grandiosity, invulnerability, etc., but may also include
themes of suspiciousness or paranoia, especially with
respect to others’ doubts about the individual’s capaci-
ties, accomplishments, and so forth.
With mood-incongruent psychotic features: The con-
tent of delusions and hallucinations is inconsistent with
the episode polarity themes as described above, or the
content is a mixture of mood-incongruent and mood-
congruent themes.
With catatonia: This specifier can apply to an episode of mania
or depression if catatonic features are present during most of the
episode. See criteria for catatonia associated with a mental dis-
order in the chapter “Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psy-
chotic Disorders.”
With peripartum onset: This specifier can be applied to the cur-
rent or, if the full criteria are not currently met for a mood episode,
most recent episode of mania, hypomania, or major depression
in bipolar I or bipolar II disorder if onset of mood symptoms oc-
curs during pregnancy or in the 4 weeks following delivery.
Note: Mood episodes can have their onset either during preg-
nancy or postpartum. Although the estimates differ according
to the period of follow-up after delivery, between 3% and 6% of
women will experience the onset of a major depressive epi-
sode during pregnancy or in the weeks or months following
delivery. Fifty percent of “postpartum” major depressive epi-
sodes actually begin prior to delivery. Thus, these episodes
are referred to collectively as peripartum episodes. Women
with peripartum major depressive episodes often have severe
anxiety and even panic attacks. Prospective studies have
demonstrated that mood and anxiety symptoms during preg-
nancy, as well as the “baby blues,” increase the risk for a post-
partum major depressive episode.
Peripartum-onset mood episodes can present either with
or without psychotic features. Infanticide is most often asso-

90 Bipolar and Related Disorders
ciated with postpartum psychotic episodes that are charac-
terized by command hallucinations to kill the infant or
delusions that the infant is possessed, but psychotic symp-
toms can also occur in severe postpartum mood episodes
without such specific delusions or hallucinations.
Postpartum mood (major depressive or manic) episodes
with psychotic features appear to occur in from 1 in 500 to 1
in 1,000 deliveries and may be more common in primiparous
women. The risk of postpartum episodes with psychotic fea-
tures is particularly increased for women with prior postpar-
tum mood episodes but is also elevated for those with a prior
history of a depressive or bipolar disorder (especially bipolar
I disorder) and those with a family history of bipolar disorders.
Once a woman has had a postpartum episode with psy-
chotic features, the risk of recurrence with each subsequent
delivery is between 30% and 50%. Postpartum episodes
must be differentiated from delirium occurring in the postpar-
tum period, which is distinguished by a fluctuating level of
awareness or attention. The postpartum period is unique with
respect to the degree of neuroendocrine alterations and psy-
chosocial adjustments, the potential impact of breast-feed-
ing on treatment planning, and the long-term implications of
a history of postpartum mood disorder on subsequent family
planning.
With seasonal pattern: This specifier applies to the lifetime pat-
tern of mood episodes. The essential feature is a regular season-
al pattern of at least one type of episode (i.e., mania, hypomania,
or depression). The other types of episodes may not follow this
pattern. For example, an individual may have seasonal manias,
but his or her depressions do not regularly occur at a specific
time of year.
A. There has been a regular temporal relationship between the
onset of manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episodes
and a particular time of the year (e.g., in the fall or winter) in
bipolar I or bipolar II disorder.
Note: Do not include cases in which there is an obvious ef-
fect of seasonally related psychosocial stressors (e.g., regu-
larly being unemployed every winter).

Specifiers for Bipolar and Related Disorders 91
B. Full remissions (or a change from major depression to mania
or hypomania or vice versa) also occur at a characteristic
time of the year (e.g., depression disappears in the spring).
C. In the last 2 years, the individual’s manic, hypomanic, or major
depressive episodes have demonstrated a temporal seasonal
relationship, as defined above, and no non-seasonal episodes
of that polarity have occurred during that 2-year period.
D. Seasonal manias, hypomanias, or depressions (as described
above) substantially outnumber any nonseasonal manias,
hypomanias, or depressions that may have occurred over the
individual’s lifetime.
Note: This specifier can be applied to the pattern of major de-
pressive episodes in bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, or
major depressive disorder, recurrent. The essential feature is
the onset and remission of major depressive episodes at char-
acteristic times of the year. In most cases, the episodes begin
in fall or winter and remit in spring. Less commonly, there may
be recurrent summer depressive episodes. This pattern of on-
set and remission of episodes must have occurred during at
least a 2-year period, without any nonseasonal episodes oc-
curring during this period. In addition, the seasonal depressive
episodes must substantially outnumber any nonseasonal de-
pressive episodes over the individual’s lifetime.
This specifier does not apply to those situations in which
the pattern is better explained by seasonally linked psycho-
social stressors (e.g., seasonal unemployment or school
schedule). Major depressive episodes that occur in a seasonal
pattern are often characterized by loss of energy, hyper-
somnia, overeating, weight gain, and a craving for carbohy-
drates. It is unclear whether a seasonal pattern is more likely
in recurrent major depressive disorder or in bipolar disorders.
However, within the bipolar disorders group, a seasonal pattern
appears to be more likely in bipolar II disorder than in bipolar
I disorder. In some individuals, the onset of manic or hypo-
manic episodes may also be linked to a particular season.
The prevalence of winter-type seasonal pattern appears to
vary with latitude, age, and sex. Prevalence increases with
higher latitudes. Age is also a strong predictor of seasonality,

92 Bipolar and Related Disorders
with younger persons at higher risk for winter depressive
episodes.
Specify if:
In partial remission: Symptoms of the immediately previous
manic, hypomanic, or depressive episode are present, but full
criteria are not met, or there is a period lasting less than 2 months
without any significant symptoms of a manic, hypomanic, or ma-
jor depressive episode following the end of such an episode.
In full remission: During the past 2 months, no significant signs
or symptoms of the disturbance were present.
Specify current severity:
Severity is based on the number of criterion symptoms, the severity
of those symptoms, and the degree of functional disability.
Mild: Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to meet
the diagnostic criteria are present, the intensity of the symptoms
is distressing but manageable, and the symptoms result in minor
impairment in social or occupational functioning.
Moderate: The number of symptoms, intensity of symptoms, and/
or functional impairment are between those specified for “mild”
and “severe.”
Severe: The number of symptoms is substantially in excess of
those required to make the diagnosis, the intensity of the symp-
toms is seriously distressing and unmanageable, and the symp-
toms markedly interfere with social and occupational functioning.

Depressive
Disorders
Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder
296.99 (F34.8)
A. Severe recurrent temper outbursts manifested verbally (e.g., ver-
bal rages) and/or behaviorally (e.g., physical aggression toward
people or property) that are grossly out of proportion in intensity
or duration to the situation or provocation.
B. The temper outbursts are inconsistent with developmental level.
C. The temper outbursts occur, on average, three or more times per
week.
D. The mood between temper outbursts is persistently irritable or
angry most of the day, nearly every day, and is observable by
others (e.g., parents, teachers, peers).
E. Criteria A–D have been present for 12 or more months. Through-
out that time, the individual has not had a period lasting 3 or more
consecutive months without all of the symptoms in Criteria A–D.
F. Criteria A and D are present in at least two of three settings (i.e., at
home, at school, with peers) and are severe in at least one of these.
G. The diagnosis should not be made for the first time before age
6 years or after age 18 years.
H. By history or observation, the age at onset of Criteria A–E is be-
fore 10 years.
I. There has never been a distinct period lasting more than 1 day
during which the full symptom criteria, except duration, for a
manic or hypomanic episode have been met.
Note: Developmentally appropriate mood elevation, such as oc-
curs in the context of a highly positive event or its anticipation,
should not be considered as a symptom of mania or hypomania.
J. The behaviors do not occur exclusively during an episode of ma-
jor depressive disorder and are not better explained by another
93

94 Depressive Disorders
mental disorder (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, posttraumatic
stress disorder, separation anxiety disorder, persistent depres-
sive disorder [dysthymia]).
Note: This diagnosis cannot coexist with oppositional defiant dis-
order, intermittent explosive disorder, or bipolar disorder, though
it can coexist with others, including major depressive disorder,
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and sub-
stance use disorders. Individuals whose symptoms meet criteria
for both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and oppositional
defiant disorder should only be given the diagnosis of disruptive
mood dysregulation disorder. If an individual has ever experienced
a manic or hypomanic episode, the diagnosis of disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder should not be assigned.
K. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of
a substance or to another medical or neurological condition.
Major Depressive Disorder
A. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present dur-
ing the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous
functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed
mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.
Note: Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to
another medical condition.
1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indi-
cated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty,
hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tear-
ful). (Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable
mood.)
2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all,
activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by
either subjective account or observation).
3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g.,
a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or de-
crease or increase in appetite nearly every day. (Note: In
children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)
4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.

Major Depressive Disorder 95
5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (ob-
servable by others, not merely subjective feelings of rest-
lessness or being slowed down).
6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.
7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt
(which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-
reproach or guilt about being sick).
8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness,
nearly every day (either by subjective account or as ob-
served by others).
9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent
suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt
or a specific plan for committing suicide.
B. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
C. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance or to another medical condition.
Note: Criteria A–C represent a major depressive episode.
Note: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial ru-
in, losses from a natural disaster, a serious medical illness or disabil-
ity) may include the feelings of intense sadness, rumination about the
loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Criterion A,
which may resemble a depressive episode. Although such symptoms
may be understandable or considered appropriate to the loss, the
presence of a major depressive episode in addition to the normal re-
sponse to a significant loss should also be carefully considered. This
decision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical judgment based on
the individual’s history and the cultural norms for the expression of
distress in the context of loss.1
D. The occurrence of the major depressive episode is not better
explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizo-
phreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified and un-
specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.
E. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode.
Note: This exclusion does not apply if all of the manic-like or hy-
pomanic-like episodes are substance-induced or are attributable
to the physiological effects of another medical condition.

Coding and Recording Procedures
The diagnostic code for major depressive disorder is based on
whether this is a single or recurrent episode, current severity, pres-
ence of psychotic features, and remission status. Current severity
and psychotic features are only indicated if full criteria are currently
met for a major depressive episode. Remission specifiers are only in-
dicated if the full criteria are not currently met for a major depressive
episode. Codes are as follows:
Severity/course specifier Single episode Recurrent episode*
Mild (p. 114) 296.21 (F32.0) 296.31 (F33.0)
Moderate (p. 114) 296.22 (F32.1) 296.32 (F33.1)
Severe (p. 114) 296.23 (F32.2) 296.33 (F33.2)
With psychotic features** 296.24 (F32.3) 296.34 (F33.3)
(p. 111)
In partial remission (p. 114) 296.25 (F32.4) 296.35 (F33.41)
1In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is useful to
consider that in grief the predominant affect is feelings of emptiness and loss,
while in an MDE, it is persistent depressed mood and the inability to anticipate
happiness or pleasure. The dysphoria in grief is likely to decrease in intensity
over days to weeks and occurs in waves, the so-called pangs of grief. These
waves tend to be associated with thoughts or reminders of the deceased. The
depressed mood of an MDE is more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts
or preoccupations. The pain of grief may be accompanied by positive emotions
and humor that are uncharacteristic of the pervasive unhappiness and misery
characteristic of an MDE. The thought content associated with grief generally
features a preoccupation with thoughts and memories of the deceased, rather
than the self-critical or pessimistic ruminations seen in an MDE. In grief, self-
esteem is generally preserved, whereas in an MDE, feelings of worthlessness
and self-loathing are common. If self-derogatory ideation is present in grief, it
typically involves perceived failings vis-à-vis the deceased (e.g., not visiting
frequently enough, not telling the deceased how much he or she was loved). If
a bereaved individual thinks about death and dying, such thoughts are gener-
ally focused on the deceased and possibly about “joining” the deceased,
whereas in an MDE, such thoughts are focused on ending one’s own life be-
cause of feeling worthless, undeserving of life, or unable to cope with the pain
of depression.

Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) 97
Severity/course specifier Single episode Recurrent episode*
In full remission (p. 114) 296.26 (F32.5) 296.36 (F33.42)
Unspecified 296.20 (F32.9) 296.30 (F33.9)
*For an episode to be considered recurrent, there must be an interval of at
least 2 consecutive months between separate episodes in which criteria are
not met for a major depressive episode. The definitions of specifiers are found
on the indicated pages.
**If psychotic features are present, code the “with psychotic features” specifier
irrespective of episode severity.
In recording the name of a diagnosis, terms should be listed in the fol-
lowing order: major depressive disorder, single or recurrent episode,
severity/psychotic/remission specifiers, followed by as many of the
following specifiers without codes that apply to the current episode.
Specify:
With anxious distress (pp. 107–108)
With mixed features (pp. 108–109)
With melancholic features (pp. 109–110)
With atypical features (pp. 110–111)
With mood-congruent psychotic features (p. 111)
With mood-incongruent psychotic features (p. 111)
With catatonia (p. 111). Coding note: Use additional code
293.89 (F06.1).
With peripartum onset (pp. 111–112)
With seasonal pattern (recurrent episode only) (pp. 113–114)
Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)
300.4 (F34.1)
This disorder represents a consolidation of DSM-IV-defined chronic
major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder.
A. Depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than not, as
indicated by either subjective account or observation by others,
for at least 2 years.
Note: In children and adolescents, mood can be irritable and du-
ration must be at least 1 year.

98 Depressive Disorders
B. Presence, while depressed, of two (or more) of the following:
1. Poor appetite or overeating.
2. Insomnia or hypersomnia.
3. Low energy or fatigue.
4. Low self-esteem.
5. Poor concentration or difficulty making decisions.
6. Feelings of hopelessness.
C. During the 2-year period (1 year for children or adolescents) of
the disturbance, the individual has never been without the symp-
toms in Criteria A and B for more than 2 months at a time.
D. Criteria for a major depressive disorder may be continuously pres-
ent for 2 years.
E. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode,
and criteria have never been met for cyclothymic disorder.
F. The disturbance is not better explained by a persistent schizo-
affective disorder, schizophrenia, delusional disorder, or other
specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psy-
chotic disorder.
G. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of
a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another
medical condition (e.g., hypothyroidism).
H. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
Note: Because the criteria for a major depressive episode include
four symptoms that are absent from the symptom list for persistent
depressive disorder (dysthymia), a very limited number of individuals
will have depressive symptoms that have persisted longer than 2 years
but will not meet criteria for persistent depressive disorder. If full cri-
teria for a major depressive episode have been met at some point
during the current episode of illness, they should be given a diagno-
sis of major depressive disorder. Otherwise, a diagnosis of other
specified depressive disorder or unspecified depressive disorder is
warranted.

Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) 99

100 Depressive Disorders
Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder
625.4 (N94.3)
A. In the majority of menstrual cycles, at least five symptoms must
be present in the final week before the onset of menses, start to
improve within a few days after the onset of menses, and be-
come minimal or absent in the week postmenses.
B. One (or more) of the following symptoms must be present:
1. Marked affective lability (e.g., mood swings; feeling suddenly
sad or tearful, or increased sensitivity to rejection).
2. Marked irritability or anger or increased interpersonal con-
flicts.
3. Marked depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness, or self-
deprecating thoughts.
4. Marked anxiety, tension, and/or feelings of being keyed up or
on edge.
C. One (or more) of the following symptoms must additionally be
present, to reach a total of five symptoms when combined with
symptoms from Criterion B.
1. Decreased interest in usual activities (e.g., work, school,
friends, hobbies).
2. Subjective difficulty in concentration.
3. Lethargy, easy fatigability, or marked lack of energy.
4. Marked change in appetite; overeating; or specific food
cravings.
5. Hypersomnia or insomnia.
6. A sense of being overwhelmed or out of control.
7. Physical symptoms such as breast tenderness or swelling,
joint or muscle pain, a sensation of “bloating,” or weight gain.
Note: The symptoms in Criteria A–C must have been met for most
menstrual cycles that occurred in the preceding year.
D. The symptoms are associated with clinically significant distress
or interference with work, school, usual social activities, or rela-
tionships with others (e.g., avoidance of social activities; de-
creased productivity and efficiency at work, school, or home).

Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder 101
E. The disturbance is not merely an exacerbation of the symptoms of
another disorder, such as major depressive disorder, panic disor-
der, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), or a personality dis-
order (although it may co-occur with any of these disorders).
F. Criterion A should be confirmed by prospective daily ratings dur-
ing at least two symptomatic cycles. (Note: The diagnosis may
be made provisionally prior to this confirmation.)
G. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of
a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treat-
ment) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism).
Recording Procedures
If symptoms have not been confirmed by prospective daily ratings of
at least two symptomatic cycles, “provisional” should be noted after
the name of the diagnosis (i.e., “premenstrual dysphoric disorder,
provisional”).
Substance/Medication-Induced
Depressive Disorder
A. A prominent and persistent disturbance in mood that predomi-
nates in the clinical picture and is characterized by depressed
mood or markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost
all, activities.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or lab-
oratory findings of both (1) and (2):
1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after
substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a
medication.
2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing
the symptoms in Criterion A.
C. The disturbance is not better explained by a depressive disorder
that is not substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an
independent depressive disorder could include the following:
The symptoms preceded the onset of the substance/medica-
tion use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of

102 Depressive Disorders
time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute with-
drawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence sug-
gesting the existence of an independent non-substance/
medication-induced depressive disorder (e.g., a history of re-
current non-substance/medication-related episodes).
D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of
a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
Note: This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of sub-
stance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms
in Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and when they are
sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific
substance/medication]-induced depressive disorders are indicated in
the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether
or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the
same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comor-
bid with the substance-induced depressive disorder, the 4th position
character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use
disorder” before the substance-induced depressive disorder (e.g.,
“mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced depressive disor-
der”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with
the substance-induced depressive disorder, the 4th position charac-
ter is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use
disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the se-
verity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid
substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the sub-
stance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should
record only the substance-induced depressive disorder.

tive Disorders” for diagnoses associated with substance class):
With onset during intoxication: If criteria are met for intoxication
with the substance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.
With onset during withdrawal: If criteria are met for withdrawal
from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly
after, withdrawal.
Recording Procedures
ICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced de-
pressive disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine,
dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the depressive
symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in

104 Depressive Disorders
the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that
do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for
“other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance
is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance
is unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used.
The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset
(i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal). Unlike the
recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the substance-
induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single code, for ICD-
9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder.
For example, in the case of depressive symptoms occurring during with-
drawal in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is
292.84 cocaine-induced depressive disorder, with onset during with-
drawal. An additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe cocaine use disorder is
also given. When more than one substance is judged to play a significant
role in the development of depressive mood symptoms, each should be
listed separately (e.g., 292.84 methylphenidate-induced depressive dis-
order, with onset during withdrawal; 292.84 dexamethasone-induced
depressive disorder, with onset during intoxication).
ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced de-
pressive disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine,
dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the depressive
symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in
the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or ab-
sence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For substances that do
not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for
“other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance
is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance
is unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used.
When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid sub-
stance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word “with,”
followed by the name of the substance-induced depressive disorder,
followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication,
onset during withdrawal). For example, in the case of depressive symp-
toms occurring during withdrawal in a man with a severe cocaine use
disorder, the diagnosis is F14.24 severe cocaine use disorder with co-
caine-induced depressive disorder, with onset during withdrawal. A
separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe cocaine use disorder is not

Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition 105
given. If the substance-induced depressive disorder occurs without a
comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of
the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g.,
F16.94 phencyclidine-induced depressive disorder, with onset during
intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a sig-
nificant role in the development of depressive mood symptoms, each
should be listed separately (e.g., F15.24 severe methylphenidate use
disorder with methylphenidate-induced depressive disorder, with
onset during withdrawal; F19.94 dexamethasone-induced depressive
disorder, with onset during intoxication).
Depressive Disorder
Due to Another Medical Condition
A. A prominent and persistent period of depressed mood or mark-
edly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities
that predominates in the clinical picture.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or lab-
oratory findings that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiolog-
ical consequence of another medical condition.
C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disor-
der (e.g., adjustment disorder, with depressed mood, in which the
stressor is a serious medical condition).
D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of
a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code for depressive disorder due to an-
other medical condition is 293.83, which is assigned regardless of the
specifier. The ICD-10-CM code depends on the specifier (see below).
Specify if:
(F06.31) With depressive features: Full criteria are not met for
a major depressive episode.
(F06.32) With major depressive–like episode: Full criteria are
met (except Criterion C) for a major depressive episode.
(F06.34) With mixed features: Symptoms of mania or hypoma-
nia are also present but do not predominate in the clinical picture.

106 Depressive Disorders
Coding note: Include the name of the other medical condition in the
name of the mental disorder (e.g., 293.83 [F06.31] depressive disor-
der due to hypothyroidism, with depressive features). The other med-
ical condition should also be coded and listed separately immediately
before the depressive disorder due to the medical condition (e.g.,
244.9 [E03.9] hypothyroidism; 293.83 [F06.31] depressive disorder
due to hypothyroidism, with depressive features).
Other Specified Depressive Disorder
311 (F32.8)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a depressive disorder that cause clinically significant distress
or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the depressive disorders diagnostic class. The other
specified depressive disorder category is used in situations in which
the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the
presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific depressive
disorder. This is done by recording “other specified depressive disor-
der” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “short-duration depressive
episode”).
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other
specified” designation include the following:
1. Recurrent brief depression: Concurrent presence of depressed
mood and at least four other symptoms of depression for 2–13
days at least once per month (not associated with the menstrual
cycle) for at least 12 consecutive months in an individual whose
presentation has never met criteria for any other depressive or
bipolar disorder and does not currently meet active or residual
criteria for any psychotic disorder.
2. Short-duration depressive episode (4–13 days): Depressed
affect and at least four of the other eight symptoms of a major de-
pressive episode associated with clinically significant distress or
impairment that persists for more than 4 days, but less than 14 days,
in an individual whose presentation has never met criteria for any
other depressive or bipolar disorder, does not currently meet ac-

Unspecified Depressive Disorder 107
tive or residual criteria for any psychotic disorder, and does not
meet criteria for recurrent brief depression.
3. Depressive episode with insufficient symptoms: Depressed
affect and at least one of the other eight symptoms of a major de-
pressive episode associated with clinically significant distress or
impairment that persist for at least 2 weeks in an individual whose
presentation has never met criteria for any other depressive or
bipolar disorder, does not currently meet active or residual crite-
ria for any psychotic disorder, and does not meet criteria for
mixed anxiety and depressive disorder symptoms.
Unspecified Depressive Disorder
311 (F32.9)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a depressive disorder that cause clinically significant distress
or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the depressive disorders diagnostic class. The unspeci-
fied depressive disorder category is used in situations in which the
clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not
met for a specific depressive disorder, and includes presentations for
which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diag-
nosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).
Specifiers for Depressive Disorders
Specify if:
With anxious distress: Anxious distress is defined as the pres-
ence of at least two of the following symptoms during the majority
of days of a major depressive episode or persistent depressive
disorder (dysthymia):
1. Feeling keyed up or tense.
2. Feeling unusually restless.
3. Difficulty concentrating because of worry.

108 Depressive Disorders
4. Fear that something awful may happen.
5. Feeling that the individual might lose control of himself or
herself.
Specify current severity:
Mild: Two symptoms.
Moderate: Three symptoms.
Moderate-severe: Four or five symptoms.
Severe: Four or five symptoms and with motor agitation.
Note: Anxious distress has been noted as a prominent feature of
both bipolar and major depressive disorder in both primary care
and specialty mental health settings. High levels of anxiety have
been associated with higher suicide risk, longer duration of ill-
ness, and greater likelihood of treatment nonresponse. As a result,
it is clinically useful to specify accurately the presence and sever-
ity levels of anxious distress for treatment planning and monitor-
ing of response to treatment.
With mixed features:
A. At least three of the following manic/hypomanic symptoms
are present nearly every day during the majority of days of a
major depressive episode:
1. Elevated, expansive mood.
2. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.
3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.
4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are
racing.
5. Increase in energy or goal-directed activity (either socially,
at work or school, or sexually).
6. Increased or excessive involvement in activities that
have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., en-
gaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscre-
tions, foolish business investments).
7. Decreased need for sleep (feeling rested despite sleep-
ing less than usual; to be contrasted with insomnia).
B. Mixed symptoms are observable by others and represent a
change from the person’s usual behavior.

Specifiers for Depressive Disorders 109
C. For individuals whose symptoms meet full criteria for either
mania or hypomania, the diagnosis should be bipolar I or bi-
polar II disorder.
D. The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physiological
effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication or
other treatment).
Note: Mixed features associated with a major depressive ep-
isode have been found to be a significant risk factor for the
development of bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. As a result, it
is clinically useful to note the presence of this specifier for
treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment.
With melancholic features:
A. One of the following is present during the most severe period
of the current episode:
1. Loss of pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.
2. Lack of reactivity to usually pleasurable stimuli (does not
feel much better, even temporarily, when something
good happens).
B. Three (or more) of the following:
1. A distinct quality of depressed mood characterized by
profound despondency, despair, and/or moroseness or by
so-called empty mood.
2. Depression that is regularly worse in the morning.
3. Early-morning awakening (i.e., at least 2 hours before
usual awakening).
4. Marked psychomotor agitation or retardation.
5. Significant anorexia or weight loss.
6. Excessive or inappropriate guilt.
Note: The specifier “with melancholic features” is applied if these
features are present at the most severe stage of the episode.
There is a near-complete absence of the capacity for pleasure,
not merely a diminution. A guideline for evaluating the lack of
reactivity of mood is that even highly desired events are not as-
sociated with marked brightening of mood. Either mood does not
brighten at all, or it brightens only partially (e.g., up to 20%–40%
of normal for only minutes at a time). The “distinct quality” of

110 Depressive Disorders
mood that is characteristic of the “with melancholic features”
specifier is experienced as qualitatively different from that during
a nonmelancholic depressive episode. A depressed mood that
is described as merely more severe, longer lasting, or present
without a reason is not considered distinct in quality. Psycho-
motor changes are nearly always present and are observable by
others.
Melancholic features exhibit only a modest tendency to repeat
across episodes in the same individual. They are more frequent
in inpatients, as opposed to outpatients; are less likely to occur
in milder than in more severe major depressive episodes; and
are more likely to occur in those with psychotic features.
With atypical features: This specifier can be applied when
these features predominate during the majority of days of the
current or most recent major depressive episode or persistent
depressive disorder.
A. Mood reactivity (i.e., mood brightens in response to actual or
potential positive events).
B. Two (or more) of the following:
1. Significant weight gain or increase in appetite.
2. Hypersomnia.
3. Leaden paralysis (i.e., heavy, leaden feelings in arms or
legs).
4. A long-standing pattern of interpersonal rejection sensi-
tivity (not limited to episodes of mood disturbance) that
results in significant social or occupational impairment.
C. Criteria are not met for “with melancholic features” or “with
catatonia” during the same episode.
Note: “Atypical depression” has historical significance (i.e., atypical
in contradistinction to the more classical agitated, “endogenous”
presentations of depression that were the norm when depression
was rarely diagnosed in outpatients and almost never in adoles-
cents or younger adults) and today does not connote an uncommon
or unusual clinical presentation as the term might imply.
Mood reactivity is the capacity to be cheered up when present-
ed with positive events (e.g., a visit from children, compliments
from others). Mood may become euthymic (not sad) even for ex-

Specifiers for Depressive Disorders 111
tended periods of time if the external circumstances remain fa-
vorable. Increased appetite may be manifested by an obvious
increase in food intake or by weight gain. Hypersomnia may in-
clude either an extended period of nighttime sleep or daytime
napping that totals at least 10 hours of sleep per day (or at least
2 hours more than when not depressed). Leaden paralysis is de-
fined as feeling heavy, leaden, or weighted down, usually in the
arms or legs. This sensation is generally present for at least an
hour a day but often lasts for many hours at a time. Unlike the
other atypical features, pathological sensitivity to perceived inter-
personal rejection is a trait that has an early onset and persists
throughout most of adult life. Rejection sensitivity occurs both
when the person is and is not depressed, though it may be exac-
erbated during depressive periods.
With psychotic features: Delusions and/or hallucinations are
present.
With mood-congruent psychotic features: The content of
all delusions and hallucinations is consistent with the typical
depressive themes of personal inadequacy, guilt, disease,
death, nihilism, or deserved punishment.
With mood-incongruent psychotic features: The content
of the delusions or hallucinations does not involve typical
depressive themes of personal inadequacy, guilt, disease,
death, nihilism, or deserved punishment, or the content is a
mixture of mood-incongruent and mood-congruent themes.
With catatonia: The catatonia specifier can apply to an episode
of depression if catatonic features are present during most of the
episode. See criteria for catatonia associated with a mental dis-
order in the chapter “Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psy-
chotic Disorders.”
With peripartum onset: This specifier can be applied to the cur-
rent or, if full criteria are not currently met for a major depressive
episode, most recent episode of major depression if onset of
mood symptoms occurs during pregnancy or in the 4 weeks fol-
lowing delivery.
Note: Mood episodes can have their onset either during preg-
nancy or postpartum. Although the estimates differ according

112 Depressive Disorders
to the period of follow-up after delivery, between 3% and 6%
of women will experience the onset of a major depressive
episode during pregnancy or in the weeks or months follow-
ing delivery. Fifty percent of “postpartum” major depressive
episodes actually begin prior to delivery. Thus, these episodes
are referred to collectively as peripartum episodes. Women
with peripartum major depressive episodes often have se-
vere anxiety and even panic attacks. Prospective studies
have demonstrated that mood and anxiety symptoms during
pregnancy, as well as the “baby blues,” increase the risk for
a postpartum major depressive episode.
Peripartum-onset mood episodes can present either with
or without psychotic features. Infanticide is most often associ-
ated with postpartum psychotic episodes that are character-
ized by command hallucinations to kill the infant or delusions
that the infant is possessed, but psychotic symptoms can
also occur in severe postpartum mood episodes without such
specific delusions or hallucinations.
Postpartum mood (major depressive or manic) episodes
with psychotic features appear to occur in from 1 in 500 to
1 in 1,000 deliveries and may be more common in primipa-
rous women. The risk of postpartum episodes with psychotic
features is particularly increased for women with prior post-
partum mood episodes but is also elevated for those with a
prior history of a depressive or bipolar disorder (especially
bipolar I disorder) and those with a family history of bipolar
disorders.
Once a woman has had a postpartum episode with psy-
chotic features, the risk of recurrence with each subsequent
delivery is between 30% and 50%. Postpartum episodes
must be differentiated from delirium occurring in the postpar-
tum period, which is distinguished by a fluctuating level of
awareness or attention. The postpartum period is unique
with respect to the degree of neuroendocrine alterations and
psychosocial adjustments, the potential impact of breast-
feeding on treatment planning, and the long-term implica-
tions of a history of postpartum mood disorder on subse-
quent family planning.

Specifiers for Depressive Disorders 113
With seasonal pattern: This specifier applies to recurrent major
depressive disorder.
A. There has been a regular temporal relationship between the
onset of major depressive episodes in major depressive disor-
der and a particular time of the year (e.g., in the fall or winter).
Note: Do not include cases in which there is an obvious ef-
fect of seasonally related psychosocial stressors (e.g., regu-
larly being unemployed every winter).
B. Full remissions (or a change from major depression to mania
or hypomania) also occur at a characteristic time of the year
(e.g., depression disappears in the spring).
C. In the last 2 years, two major depressive episodes have oc-
curred that demonstrate the temporal seasonal relationships
defined above and no nonseasonal major depressive epi-
sodes have occurred during that same period.
D. Seasonal major depressive episodes (as described above)
substantially outnumber the nonseasonal major depressive
episodes that may have occurred over the individual’s life-
time.
Note: The specifier “with seasonal pattern” can be applied to the
pattern of major depressive episodes in major depressive disor-
der, recurrent. The essential feature is the onset and remission of
major depressive episodes at characteristic times of the year. In
most cases, the episodes begin in fall or winter and remit in spring.
Less commonly, there may be recurrent summer depressive epi-
sodes. This pattern of onset and remission of episodes must have
occurred during at least a 2-year period, without any nonseasonal
episodes occurring during this period. In addition, the seasonal de-
pressive episodes must substantially outnumber any nonseasonal
depressive episodes over the individual’s lifetime.
This specifier does not apply to those situations in which the pat-
tern is better explained by seasonally linked psychosocial stress-
ors (e.g., seasonal unemployment or school schedule). Major
depressive episodes that occur in a seasonal pattern are often char-
acterized by loss of energy, hypersomnia, overeating, weight
gain, and a craving for carbohydrates. It is unclear whether a sea-
sonal pattern is more likely in recurrent major depressive disorder

114 Depressive Disorders
or in bipolar disorders. However, within the bipolar disorders
group, a seasonal pattern appears to be more likely in bipolar II
disorder than in bipolar I disorder. In some individuals, the onset
of manic or hypomanic episodes may also be linked to a particular
season.
The prevalence of winter-type seasonal pattern appears to vary
with latitude, age, and sex. Prevalence increases with higher lat-
itudes. Age is also a strong predictor of seasonality, with younger
persons at higher risk for winter depressive episodes.
Specify if:
In partial remission: Symptoms of the immediately previous
major depressive episode are present, but full criteria are not
met, or there is a period lasting less than 2 months without any
significant symptoms of a major depressive episode following the
end of such an episode.
In full remission: During the past 2 months, no significant signs
or symptoms of the disturbance were present.
Specify current severity:
Severity is based on the number of criterion symptoms, the severity
of those symptoms, and the degree of functional disability.
Mild: Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to make
the diagnosis are present, the intensity of the symptoms is dis-
tressing but manageable, and the symptoms result in minor im-
pairment in social or occupational functioning.
Moderate: The number of symptoms, intensity of symptoms,
and/or functional impairment are between those specified for
“mild” and “severe.”
Severe: The number of symptoms is substantially in excess of
that required to make the diagnosis, the intensity of the symp-
toms is seriously distressing and unmanageable, and the symp-
toms markedly interfere with social and occupational functioning.

Anxiety
Disorders
Separation Anxiety Disorder
309.21 (F93.0)
A. Developmentally inappropriate and excessive fear or anxiety
concerning separation from those to whom the individual is at-
tached, as evidenced by at least three of the following:
1. Recurrent excessive distress when anticipating or experiencing
separation from home or from major attachment figures.
2. Persistent and excessive worry about losing major attach-
ment figures or about possible harm to them, such as illness,
injury, disasters, or death.
3. Persistent and excessive worry about experiencing an un-
toward event (e.g., getting lost, being kidnapped, having an
accident, becoming ill) that causes separation from a major
attachment figure.
4. Persistent reluctance or refusal to go out, away from home, to
school, to work, or elsewhere because of fear of separation.
5. Persistent and excessive fear of or reluctance about being
alone or without major attachment figures at home or in other
settings.
6. Persistent reluctance or refusal to sleep away from home or
to go to sleep without being near a major attachment figure.
7. Repeated nightmares involving the theme of separation.
8. Repeated complaints of physical symptoms (e.g., head-
aches, stomachaches, nausea, vomiting) when separation
from major attachment figures occurs or is anticipated.
B. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, lasting at least 4 weeks
in children and adolescents and typically 6 months or more in
adults.
115

116 Anxiety Disorders
C. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impair-
ment in social, academic, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning.
D. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disor-
der, such as refusing to leave home because of excessive resis-
tance to change in autism spectrum disorder; delusions or
hallucinations concerning separation in psychotic disorders; re-
fusal to go outside without a trusted companion in agoraphobia;
worries about ill health or other harm befalling significant others
in generalized anxiety disorder; or concerns about having an ill-
ness in illness anxiety disorder.
Selective Mutism
313.23 (F94.0)
A. Consistent failure to speak in specific social situations in which
there is an expectation for speaking (e.g., at school) despite
speaking in other situations.
B. The disturbance interferes with educational or occupational
achievement or with social communication.
C. The duration of the disturbance is at least 1 month (not limited to
the first month of school).
D. The failure to speak is not attributable to a lack of knowledge of, or
comfort with, the spoken language required in the social situation.
E. The disturbance is not better explained by a communication dis-
order (e.g., childhood-onset fluency disorder) and does not oc-
cur exclusively during the course of autism spectrum disorder,
schizophrenia, or another psychotic disorder.
Specific Phobia
A. Marked fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation (e.g.,
flying, heights, animals, receiving an injection, seeing blood).
Note: In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by cry-
ing, tantrums, freezing, or clinging.
B. The phobic object or situation almost always provokes immedi-
ate fear or anxiety.

Specific Phobia 117
C. The phobic object or situation is actively avoided or endured with
intense fear or anxiety.
D. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed
by the specific object or situation and to the sociocultural context.
E. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for
6 months or more.
F. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant dis-
tress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important ar-
eas of functioning.
G. The disturbance is not better explained by the symptoms of an-
other mental disorder, including fear, anxiety, and avoidance of
situations associated with panic-like symptoms or other inca-
pacitating symptoms (as in agoraphobia); objects or situations
related to obsessions (as in obsessive-compulsive disorder);
reminders of traumatic events (as in posttraumatic stress disor-
der); separation from home or attachment figures (as in separa-
tion anxiety disorder); or social situations (as in social anxiety
disorder).
Specify if:

Coding note. When more than one phobic stimulus is present, code all
ICD-10-CM codes that apply (e.g., for fear of snakes and flying, F40.218
specific phobia, animal, and F40.248 specific phobia, situational).

118 Anxiety Disorders
Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)
300.23 (F40.10)
A. Marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in
which the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others.
Examples include social interactions (e.g., having a conver-
sation, meeting unfamiliar people), being observed (e.g., eating
or drinking), and performing in front of others (e.g., giving a
speech).
Note: In children, the anxiety must occur in peer settings and not
just during interactions with adults.
B. The individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show anx-
iety symptoms that will be negatively evaluated (i.e., will be hu-
miliating or embarrassing; will lead to rejection or offend others).
C. The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety.
Note: In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by cry-
ing, tantrums, freezing, clinging, shrinking, or failing to speak in
social situations.
D. The social situations are avoided or endured with intense fear or
anxiety.
E. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual threat posed
by the social situation and to the sociocultural context.

6 months or more.
G. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant dis-
tress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important ar-
eas of functioning.
H. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not attributable to the physio-
logical effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medica-
tion) or another medical condition.
I. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the
symptoms of another mental disorder, such as panic disorder,
body dysmorphic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder.
J. If another medical condition (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, obesity,
disfigurement from burns or injury) is present, the fear, anxiety,
or avoidance is clearly unrelated or is excessive.

Panic Disorder 119
Specify if:
Performance only: If the fear is restricted to speaking or per-
forming in public.
Panic Disorder
300.01 (F41.0)
A. Recurrent unexpected panic attacks. A panic attack is an abrupt
surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak
within minutes, and during which time four (or more) of the follow-
ing symptoms occur:
Note: The abrupt surge can occur from a calm state or an anx-
ious state.
1. Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate.
2. Sweating.
3. Trembling or shaking.
4. Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering.
5. Feelings of choking.
6. Chest pain or discomfort.
7. Nausea or abdominal distress.
8. Feeling dizzy, unsteady, light-headed, or faint.
9. Chills or heat sensations.
10. Paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations).
11. Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization
(being detached from oneself).
12. Fear of losing control or “going crazy.”
13. Fear of dying.
Note: Culture-specific symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, neck soreness,
headache, uncontrollable screaming or crying) may be seen. Such
symptoms should not count as one of the four required symptoms.
B. At least one of the attacks has been followed by 1 month (or more)
of one or both of the following:
1. Persistent concern or worry about additional panic attacks or
their consequences (e.g., losing control, having a heart at-
tack, “going crazy”).

120 Anxiety Disorders
2. A significant maladaptive change in behavior related to the at-
tacks (e.g., behaviors designed to avoid having panic attacks,
such as avoidance of exercise or unfamiliar situations).
C. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical
condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism, cardiopulmonary disorders).
D. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental dis-
order (e.g., the panic attacks do not occur only in response to
feared social situations, as in social anxiety disorder; in response
to circumscribed phobic objects or situations, as in specific pho-
bia; in response to obsessions, as in obsessive-compulsive dis-
order; in response to reminders of traumatic events, as in
posttraumatic stress disorder; or in response to separation from
attachment figures, as in separation anxiety disorder).
Panic Attack Specifier
Note: Symptoms are presented for the purpose of identifying a panic
attack; however, panic attack is not a mental disorder and cannot be
coded. Panic attacks can occur in the context of any anxiety disorder
as well as other mental disorders (e.g., depressive disorders, posttrau-
matic stress disorder, substance use disorders) and some medical
conditions (e.g., cardiac, respiratory, vestibular, gastrointestinal). When
the presence of a panic attack is identified, it should be noted as a
specifier (e.g., “posttraumatic stress disorder with panic attacks”). For
panic disorder, the presence of panic attack is contained within the ri-
teria for the disorder and panic attack is not used as a specifier.
An abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a
peak within minutes, and during which time four (or more) of the follow-
ing symptoms occur:
Note: The abrupt surge can occur from a calm state or an anxious state.
1. Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate.
2. Sweating.
3. Trembling or shaking.
4. Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering.
5. Feelings of choking.

Agoraphobia 121
6. Chest pain or discomfort.
7. Nausea or abdominal distress.
8. Feeling dizzy, unsteady, light-headed, or faint.
9. Chills or heat sensations.
10. Paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations).
11. Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (be-
ing detached from oneself).
12. Fear of losing control or “going crazy.”
13. Fear of dying.
Note: Culture-specific symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, neck soreness, head-
ache, uncontrollable screaming or crying) may be seen. Such symp-
toms should not count as one of the four required symptoms.
Agoraphobia
300.22 (F40.00)
A. Marked fear or anxiety about two (or more) of the following five
situations:
1. Using public transportation (e.g., automobiles, buses, trains,
ships, planes).
2. Being in open spaces (e.g., parking lots, marketplaces,
bridges).
3. Being in enclosed places (e.g., shops, theaters, cinemas).
4. Standing in line or being in a crowd.
5. Being outside of the home alone.
B. The individual fears or avoids these situations because of
thoughts that escape might be difficult or help might not be avail-
able in the event of developing panic-like symptoms or other
incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms (e.g., fear of falling in
the elderly; fear of incontinence).
C. The agoraphobic situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety.
D. The agoraphobic situations are actively avoided, require the
presence of a companion, or are endured with intense fear or
anxiety.

122 Anxiety Disorders
E. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed
by the agoraphobic situations and to the sociocultural context.
F. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for
6 months or more.
G. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant dis-
tress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important ar-
eas of functioning.
H. If another medical condition (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease,
Parkinson’s disease) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is
clearly excessive.
I. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the
symptoms of another mental disorder—for example, the symp-
toms are not confined to specific phobia, situational type; do not
involve only social situations (as in social anxiety disorder); and
are not related exclusively to obsessions (as in obsessive-
compulsive disorder), perceived defects or flaws in physical
appearance (as in body dysmorphic disorder), reminders of trau-
matic events (as in posttraumatic stress disorder), or fear of sepa-
ration (as in separation anxiety disorder).
Note: Agoraphobia is diagnosed irrespective of the presence of
panic disorder. If an individual’s presentation meets criteria for panic
disorder and agoraphobia, both diagnoses should be assigned.
Generalized Anxiety Disorder
300.02 (F41.1)
A. Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occur-
ring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of
events or activities (such as work or school performance).
B. The individual finds it difficult to control the worry.
C. The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the
following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms having
been present for more days than not for the past 6 months):
Note: Only one item is required in children.
1. Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge.
2. Being easily fatigued.

Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder 123
3. Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank.
4. Irritability.
5. Muscle tension.
6. Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or rest-
less, unsatisfying sleep).
D. The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically signif-
icant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other im-
portant areas of functioning.
E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of
a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another
medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism).
F. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder
(e.g., anxiety or worry about having panic attacks in panic disor-
der, negative evaluation in social anxiety disorder [social pho-
bia], contamination or other obsessions in obsessive-compulsive
disorder, separation from attachment figures in separation anxi-
ety disorder, reminders of traumatic events in posttraumatic stress
disorder, gaining weight in anorexia nervosa, physical complaints
in somatic symptom disorder, perceived appearance flaws in body
dysmorphic disorder, having a serious illness in illness anxiety
disorder, or the content of delusional beliefs in schizophrenia or
delusional disorder).
Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder
A. Panic attacks or anxiety is predominant in the clinical picture.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or lab-
oratory findings of both (1) and (2):
1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after
substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a
medication.
2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing
the symptoms in Criterion A.
C. The disturbance is not better explained by an anxiety disorder
that is not substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an
independent anxiety disorder could include the following:

124 Anxiety Disorders
The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medica-
tion use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of
time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute with-
drawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence sug-
gesting the existence of an independent non-substance/
medication-induced anxiety disorder (e.g., a history of recur-
rent non-substance/medication-related episodes).
D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of
a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
Note: This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of sub-
stance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms
in Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and they are suffi-
ciently severe to warrant clinical attention.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific
substance/medication]-induced anxiety disorders are indicated in the
table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or
not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same
class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with
the substance-induced anxiety disorder, the 4th position character is
“1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder”
before the substance-induced anxiety disorder (e.g., “mild cocaine
use disorder with cocaine-induced anxiety disorder”). If a moderate
or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-
induced anxiety disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the cli-
nician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe
[substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid
substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disor-
der (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th
position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the sub-
stance-induced anxiety disorder.

Specify if (see Table 1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addic-
tive Disorders” for diagnoses associated with substance class):
With onset during intoxication: This specifier applies if criteria
are met for intoxication with the substance and the symptoms de-
velop during intoxication.
With onset during withdrawal: This specifier applies if criteria
are met for withdrawal from the substance and the symptoms de-
velop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.
With onset after medication use: Symptoms may appear either
at initiation of medication or after a modification or change in use.

126 Anxiety Disorders
Recording Procedures
ICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced anxi-
ety disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, salbu-
tamol) that is presumed to be causing the anxiety symptoms. The
diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set,
which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into
any of the classes (e.g., salbutamol), the code for “other substance”
should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an
etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the
category “unknown substance” should be used.
The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset
(i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal, onset during
medication use). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM,
which combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use dis-
order into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is
given for the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of anxiety
symptoms occurring during withdrawal in a man with a severe loraze-
pam use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.89 lorazepam-induced anxiety
disorder, with onset during withdrawal. An additional diagnosis of
304.10 severe lorazepam use disorder is also given. When more than one
substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of anx-
iety symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., 292.89 methylphe-
nidate-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during intoxication; 292.89
salbutamol-induced anxiety disorder, with onset after medication use).
ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced anx-
iety disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, salbu-
tamol) that is presumed to be causing the anxiety symptoms. The
diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set,
which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a co-
morbid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into
any of the classes (e.g., salbutamol), the code for “other substance”
should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an
etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the
category “unknown substance” should be used.
When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance
use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word “with,” fol-
lowed by the name of the substance-induced anxiety disorder, followed

Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition 127
by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset dur-
ing withdrawal, onset during medication use). For example, in the case
of anxiety symptoms occurring during withdrawal in a man with a se-
vere lorazepam use disorder, the diagnosis is F13.280 severe loraze-
pam use disorder with lorazepam-induced anxiety disorder, with on-
set during withdrawal. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe
lorazepam use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced anxiety
disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after
a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance
use disorder is noted (e.g., F16.980 psilocybin-induced anxiety disor-
der, with onset during intoxication). When more than one substance is
judged to play a significant role in the development of anxiety symp-
toms, each should be listed separately (e.g., F15.280 severe methylphe-
nidate use disorder with methylphenidate-induced anxiety disorder,
with onset during intoxication; F19.980 salbutamol-induced anxiety
disorder, with onset after medication use).
Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition
293.84 (F06.4)
A. Panic attacks or anxiety is predominant in the clinical picture.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or lab-
oratory findings that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiolog-
ical consequence of another medical condition.
C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental dis-
order.
D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of
a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
Coding note: Include the name of the other medical condition within
the name of the mental disorder (e.g., 293.84 [F06.4] anxiety disor-
der due to pheochromocytoma). The other medical condition should
be coded and listed separately immediately before the anxiety disor-
der due to the medical condition (e.g., 227.0 [D35.00] pheochromo-
cytoma; 293.84 [F06.4] anxiety disorder due to pheochromocytoma.

128 Anxiety Disorders
Other Specified Anxiety Disorder
300.09 (F41.8)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of an anxiety disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impair-
ment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning pre-
dominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the
anxiety disorders diagnostic class. The other specified anxiety disorder
category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to commu-
nicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the crite-
ria for any specific anxiety disorder. This is done by recording “other
specified anxiety disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “gener-
alized anxiety not occurring more days than not”).
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other
specified” designation include the following:
1. Limited-symptom attacks
2. Generalized anxiety not occurring more days than not
3. Khyâl cap (wind attacks): See “Glossary of Cultural Concepts
of Distress” in the Appendix to DSM-5.
4. Ataque de nervios (attack of nerves): See “Glossary of Cultural
Concepts of Distress” in the Appendix to DSM-5.
Unspecified Anxiety Disorder
300.00 (F41.9)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of an anxiety disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of func-
tioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the dis-
orders in the anxiety disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified anxiety
disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses
not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific
anxiety disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insuffi-
cient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emer-
gency room settings).

Obsessive-Compulsive and
Related Disorders
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder
300.3 (F42)
A. Presence of obsessions, compulsions, or both:
Obsessions are defined by (1) and (2):
1. Recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are
experienced, at some time during the disturbance, as intru-
sive and unwanted, and that in most individuals cause marked
anxiety or distress.
2. The individual attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts,
urges, or images, or to neutralize them with some other
thought or action (i.e., by performing a compulsion).
Compulsions are defined by (1) and (2):
1. Repetitive behaviors (e.g., hand washing, ordering, check-
ing) or mental acts (e.g., praying, counting, repeating words
silently) that the individual feels driven to perform in re-
sponse to an obsession or according to rules that must be
applied rigidly.
2. The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or re-
ducing anxiety or distress, or preventing some dreaded
event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts
are not connected in a realistic way with what they are de-
signed to neutralize or prevent, or are clearly excessive.
Note: Young children may not be able to articulate the
aims of these behaviors or mental acts.
B. The obsessions or compulsions are time-consuming (e.g., take
more than 1 hour per day) or cause clinically significant distress
or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning.
129

130 Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders
C. The obsessive-compulsive symptoms are not attributable to the
physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a
medication) or another medical condition.
D. The disturbance is not better explained by the symptoms of an-
other mental disorder (e.g., excessive worries, as in generalized
anxiety disorder; preoccupation with appearance, as in body dys-
morphic disorder; difficulty discarding or parting with possessions,
as in hoarding disorder; hair pulling, as in trichotillomania [hair-
pulling disorder]; skin picking, as in excoriation [skin-picking] dis-
order; stereotypies, as in stereotypic movement disorder; ritualized
eating behavior, as in eating disorders; preoccupation with sub-
stances or gambling, as in substance-related and addictive dis-
orders; preoccupation with having an illness, as in illness anxiety
disorder; sexual urges or fantasies, as in paraphilic disorders; im-
pulses, as in disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders;
guilty ruminations, as in major depressive disorder; thought inser-
tion or delusional preoccupations, as in schizophrenia spectrum
and other psychotic disorders; or repetitive patterns of behavior, as
in autism spectrum disorder).
Specify if:
With good or fair insight: The individual recognizes that obses-
sive-compulsive disorder beliefs are definitely or probably not true
or that they may or may not be true.
With poor insight: The individual thinks obsessive-compulsive
disorder beliefs are probably true.
With absent insight/delusional beliefs: The individual is com-
pletely convinced that obsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs are
true.
Specify if:
Tic-related: The individual has a current or past history of a tic
disorder.

Body Dysmorphic Disorder 131
Body Dysmorphic Disorder
300.7 (F45.22)
A. Preoccupation with one or more perceived defects or flaws in
physical appearance that are not observable or appear slight to
others.
B. At some point during the course of the disorder, the individual
has performed repetitive behaviors (e.g., mirror checking, exces-
sive grooming, skin picking, reassurance seeking) or mental acts
(e.g., comparing his or her appearance with that of others) in re-
sponse to the appearance concerns.
C. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impair-
ment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The appearance preoccupation is not better explained by con-
cerns with body fat or weight in an individual whose symptoms
meet diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder.
Specify if:
With muscle dysmorphia: The individual is preoccupied with
the idea that his or her body build is too small or insufficiently
muscular. This specifier is used even if the individual is preoccu-
pied with other body areas, which is often the case.
Specify if:
Indicate degree of insight regarding body dysmorphic disorder beliefs
(e.g., “I look ugly” or “I look deformed”).
With good or fair insight: The individual recognizes that the
body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are definitely or probably not
true or that they may or may not be true.
With poor insight: The individual thinks that the body dysmor-
phic disorder beliefs are probably true.
With absent insight/delusional beliefs: The individual is com-
pletely convinced that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are
true.

132 Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders
Hoarding Disorder
300.3 (F42)
A. Persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, re-
gardless of their actual value.
B. This difficulty is due to a perceived need to save the items and to
distress associated with discarding them.
C. The difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation
of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and
substantially compromises their intended use. If living areas are
uncluttered, it is only because of the interventions of third parties
(e.g., family members, cleaners, authorities).
D. The hoarding causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning
(including maintaining a safe environment for self and others).
E. The hoarding is not attributable to another medical condition
(e.g., brain injury, cerebrovascular disease, Prader-Willi syn-
drome).
F. The hoarding is not better explained by the symptoms of another
mental disorder (e.g., obsessions in obsessive-compulsive disor-
der, decreased energy in major depressive disorder, delusions in
schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder, cognitive deficits
in major neurocognitive disorder, restricted interests in autism
spectrum disorder).
Specify if:
With excessive acquisition: If difficulty discarding possessions
is accompanied by excessive acquisition of items that are not
needed or for which there is no available space.
Specify if:
With good or fair insight: The individual recognizes that hoard-
ing-related beliefs and behaviors (pertaining to difficulty discard-
ing items, clutter, or excessive acquisition) are problematic.
With poor insight: The individual is mostly convinced that
hoarding-related beliefs and behaviors (pertaining to difficulty
discarding items, clutter, or excessive acquisition) are not prob-
lematic despite evidence to the contrary.

Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder) 133
With absent insight/delusional beliefs: The individual is com-
pletely convinced that hoarding-related beliefs and behaviors
(pertaining to difficulty discarding items, clutter, or excessive ac-
quisition) are not problematic despite evidence to the contrary.
Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder)
312.39 (F63.3)
A. Recurrent pulling out of one’s hair, resulting in hair loss.
B. Repeated attempts to decrease or stop hair pulling.
C. The hair pulling causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The hair pulling or hair loss is not attributable to another medical
condition (e.g., a dermatological condition).
E. The hair pulling is not better explained by the symptoms of an-
other mental disorder (e.g., attempts to improve a perceived de-
fect or flaw in appearance in body dysmorphic disorder).
Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder
698.4 (L98.1)
A. Recurrent skin picking resulting in skin lesions.
B. Repeated attempts to decrease or stop skin picking.
C. The skin picking causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The skin picking is not attributable to the physiological effects of
a substance (e.g., cocaine) or another medical condition (e.g.,
scabies).
E. The skin picking is not better explained by symptoms of another
mental disorder (e.g., delusions or tactile hallucinations in a psy-
chotic disorder, attempts to improve a perceived defect or flaw in
appearance in body dysmorphic disorder, stereotypies in stereo-
typic movement disorder, or intention to harm oneself in nonsui-
cidal self-injury).

134 Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders
Substance/Medication-Induced
Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder
A. Obsessions, compulsions, skin picking, hair pulling, other body-
focused repetitive behaviors, or other symptoms characteristic of
the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders predominate in
the clinical picture.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or lab-
oratory findings of both (1) and (2):
1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after
substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a
medication.
2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing
the symptoms in Criterion A.
C. The disturbance is not better explained by an obsessive-compul-
sive and related disorder that is not substance/medication-
induced. Such evidence of an independent obsessive-compul-
sive and related disorder could include the following:
The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medica-
tion use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of
time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute with-
drawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence sug-
gesting the existence of an independent non-substance/
medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related dis-
order (e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance/medication-
related episodes).
D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of
a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
Note: This diagnosis should be made in addition to a diagnosis of
substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symp-
toms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and are suffi-
ciently severe to warrant clinical attention.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific
substance/medication]-induced obsessive-compulsive and related

Substance/Medication-Induced OCRD 135
disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM
code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use
disorder present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance
use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced obsessive-
compulsive and related disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and
the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the
substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (e.g.,
“mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced obsessive-compul-
sive and related disorder”). If a moderate or severe substance use
disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced obsessive-compul-
sive and related disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the cli-
nician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe
[substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid
substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disor-
der (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th
position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the sub-
stance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder.

Specify if (see Table 1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addic-
tive Disorders” for diagnoses associated with substance class):
With onset during intoxication: If the criteria are met for intox-
ication with the substance and the symptoms develop during in-
toxication.

136 Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders
With onset during withdrawal: If criteria are met for withdrawal
from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly
after, withdrawal.
With onset after medication use: Symptoms may appear either
at initiation of medication or after a modification or change in use.
Recording Procedures
ICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced obses-
sive-compulsive and related disorder begins with the specific sub-
stance (e.g., cocaine) that is presumed to be causing the obsessive-
compulsive and related symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected
from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug
class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes, the code
for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a sub-
stance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of
substance is unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be
used.
The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset
(i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset
after medication use). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-
CM, which combine the substance-induced disorder and substance
use disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic
code is given for the substance use disorder. For example, in the case
of repetitive behaviors occurring during intoxication in a man with a
severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.89 cocaine-induced
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, with onset during intox-
ication. An additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe cocaine use disorder
is also given. When more than one substance is judged to play a sig-
nificant role in the development of the obsessive-compulsive and re-
lated disorder, each should be listed separately.
ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced ob-
sessive-compulsive and related disorder begins with the specific
substance (e.g., cocaine) that is presumed to be causing the obses-
sive-compulsive and related symptoms. The diagnostic code is se-
lected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on
the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use
disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes, the

OCRD Due to Another Medical Condition 137
code for “other substance” with no comorbid substance use should
be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiolog-
ical factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the cate-
gory “unknown substance” with no comorbid substance use should
be used.
When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid sub-
stance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word “with,”
followed by the name of the substance-induced obsessive-compul-
sive and related disorder, followed by the specification of onset (i.e.,
onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset after
medication use). For example, in the case of repetitive behaviors oc-
curring during intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine use dis-
order, the diagnosis is F14.288 severe cocaine use disorder with co-
caine-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, with
onset during intoxication. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid se-
vere cocaine use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced ob-
sessive-compulsive and related disorder occurs without a comorbid
substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the sub-
stance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g.,
F15.988 amphetamine-induced obsessive-compulsive and related
disorder, with onset during intoxication). When more than one sub-
stance is judged to play a significant role in the development of the
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, each should be listed
separately.
Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder Due to
Another Medical Condition
294.8 (F06.8)
A. Obsessions, compulsions, preoccupations with appearance,
hoarding, skin picking, hair pulling, other body-focused repetitive
behaviors, or other symptoms characteristic of obsessive-com-
pulsive and related disorder predominate in the clinical picture.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or lab-
oratory findings that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiolog-
ical consequence of another medical condition.
C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder.

138 Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders
D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of
a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
Specify if:
With obsessive-compulsive disorder–like symptoms: If ob-
sessive-compulsive disorder–like symptoms predominate in the
clinical presentation.
With appearance preoccupations: If preoccupation with per-
ceived appearance defects or flaws predominates in the clinical
presentation.
With hoarding symptoms: If hoarding predominates in the clin-
ical presentation.
With hair-pulling symptoms: If hair pulling predominates in the
clinical presentation.
With skin-picking symptoms: If skin picking predominates in
the clinical presentation.
Coding note: Include the name of the other medical condition in the
name of the mental disorder (e.g., 294.8 [F06.8] obsessive-compulsive
and related disorder due to cerebral infarction). The other medical con-
dition should be coded and listed separately immediately before the
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to the medical condi-
tion (e.g., 438.89 [I69.398] cerebral infarction; 294.8 [F06.8] obses-
sive-compulsive and related disorder due to cerebral infarction).
Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive
and Related Disorder
300.3 (F42)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder that cause clin-
ically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the
full criteria for any of the disorders in the obsessive-compulsive and
related disorders diagnostic class. The other specified obsessive-

Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder 139
compulsive and related disorder category is used in situations in
which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that
the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific obsessive-
compulsive and related disorder. This is done by recording “other
specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder” followed by the
specific reason (e.g., “body-focused repetitive behavior disorder”).
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other
specified” designation include the following:
1. Body dysmorphic–like disorder with actual flaws: This is
similar to body dysmorphic disorder except that the defects or
flaws in physical appearance are clearly observable by others
(i.e., they are more noticeable than “slight”). In such cases, the
preoccupation with these flaws is clearly excessive and causes
significant impairment or distress.
2. Body dysmorphic–like disorder without repetitive behav-
iors: Presentations that meet body dysmorphic disorder except
that the individual has not performed repetitive behaviors or
mental acts in response to the appearance concerns.
3. Body-focused repetitive behavior disorder: This is character-
ized by recurrent body-focused repetitive behaviors (e.g., nail bit-
ing, lip biting, cheek chewing) and repeated attempts to decrease
or stop the behaviors. These symptoms cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important
areas of functioning and are not better explained by trichotilloma-
nia (hair-pulling disorder), excoriation (skin-picking) disorder, ste-
reotypic movement disorder, or nonsuicidal self-injury.
4. Obsessional jealousy: This is characterized by nondelusional
preoccupation with a partner’s perceived infidelity. The preoccu-
pations may lead to repetitive behaviors or mental acts in re-
sponse to the infidelity concerns; they cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important
areas of functioning; and they are not better explained by another
mental disorder such as delusional disorder, jealous type, or par-
anoid personality disorder.
5. Shubo-kyofu: A variant of taijin kyofusho (see “Glossary of Cul-
tural Concepts of Distress” in the Appendix to DSM-5) that is sim-
ilar to body dysmorphic disorder and is characterized by
excessive fear of having a bodily deformity.

140 Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders
6. Koro: Related to dhat syndrome (see “Glossary of Cultural Con-
cepts of Distress” in the Appendix to DSM-5), an episode of sud-
den and intense anxiety that the penis (or the vulva and nipples
in females) will recede into the body, possibly leading to death.
7. Jikoshu-kyofu: A variant of taijin kyofusho (see “Glossary of
Cultural Concepts of Distress” in the Appendix to DSM-5) char-
acterized by fear of having an offensive body odor (also termed
olfactory reference syndrome).
Unspecified Obsessive-Compulsive
and Related Disorder
300.3 (F42)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder that cause clin-
ically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for any of the disorders in the obsessive-compulsive and relat-
ed disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified obsessive-compulsive
and related disorder category is used in situations in which the clini-
cian chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for
a specific obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, and includes
presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a
more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

Trauma- and
Stressor-Related Disorders
Reactive Attachment Disorder
313.89 (F94.1)
A. A consistent pattern of inhibited, emotionally withdrawn behavior

3. Rearing in unusual settings that severely limit opportunities
to form selective attachments (e.g., institutions with high
child-to-caregiver ratios).
D. The care in Criterion C is presumed to be responsible for the dis-
turbed behavior in Criterion A (e.g., the disturbances in Criterion A
began following the lack of adequate care in Criterion C).

tent with culturally sanctioned and with age-appropriate so-
cial boundaries).
3. Diminished or absent checking back with adult caregiver af-
ter venturing away, even in unfamiliar settings.
4. Willingness to go off with an unfamiliar adult with minimal or
no hesitation.
B. The behaviors in Criterion A are not limited to impulsivity (as in
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) but include socially disin-
hibited behavior.
C. The child has experienced a pattern of extremes of insufficient
care as evidenced by at least one of the following:
1. Social neglect or deprivation in the form of persistent lack of
having basic emotional needs for comfort, stimulation, and
affection met by caregiving adults.
2. Repeated changes of primary caregivers that limit oppor-
tunities to form stable attachments (e.g., frequent changes in
foster care).

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder 143
3. Rearing in unusual settings that severely limit opportunities
to form selective attachments (e.g., institutions with high child-
to-caregiver ratios).
D. The care in Criterion C is presumed to be responsible for the dis-
turbed behavior in Criterion A (e.g., the disturbances in Criterion A
began following the pathogenic care in Criterion C).
E. The child has a developmental age of at least 9 months.
Specify if:
Persistent: The disorder has been present for more than 12 months.

sations, activities, objects, situations) that arouse distressing

Adjustment Disorders 151
memories, thoughts, or feelings about or closely associated
with the traumatic event(s).
Arousal Symptoms
10. Sleep disturbance (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep,
restless sleep).
11. Irritable behavior and angry outbursts (with little or no provo-
cation), typically expressed as verbal or physical aggression
toward people or objects.
12. Hypervigilance.
13. Problems with concentration.
14. Exaggerated startle response.
C. Duration of the disturbance (symptoms in Criterion B) is 3 days
to 1 month after trauma exposure.
Note: Symptoms typically begin immediately after the trauma,
but persistence for at least 3 days and up to a month is needed
to meet disorder criteria.
D. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of
a substance (e.g., medication or alcohol) or another medical
condition (e.g., mild traumatic brain injury) and is not better ex-
plained by brief psychotic disorder.
Adjustment Disorders
A. The development of emotional or behavioral symptoms in re-
sponse to an identifiable stressor(s) occurring within 3 months of
the onset of the stressor(s).
B. These symptoms or behaviors are clinically significant, as evi-
denced by one or both of the following:
1. Marked distress that is out of proportion to the severity or in-
tensity of the stressor, taking into account the external con-
text and the cultural factors that might influence symptom
severity and presentation.

152 Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders
2. Significant impairment in social, occupational, or other im-
portant areas of functioning.
C. The stress-related disturbance does not meet the criteria for an-
other mental disorder and is not merely an exacerbation of a pre-
existing mental disorder.
D. The symptoms do not represent normal bereavement.
E. Once the stressor or its consequences have terminated, the
symptoms do not persist for more than an additional 6 months.
Specify whether:
309.0 (F43.21) With depressed mood: Low mood, tearfulness,
or feelings of hopelessness are predominant.
309.24 (F43.22) With anxiety: Nervousness, worry, jitteriness,
or separation anxiety is predominant.
309.28 (F43.23) With mixed anxiety and depressed mood: A
combination of depression and anxiety is predominant.
309.3 (F43.24) With disturbance of conduct: Disturbance of
conduct is predominant.
309.4 (F43.25) With mixed disturbance of emotions and con-
duct: Both emotional symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety) and
a disturbance of conduct are predominant.
309.9 (F43.20) Unspecified: For maladaptive reactions that are
not classifiable as one of the specific subtypes of adjustment
disorder.
Other Specified Trauma- and
Stressor-Related Disorder
309.89 (F43.8)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a trauma- and stressor-related disorder that cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other im-
portant areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full cri-
teria for any of the disorders in the trauma- and stressor-related
disorders diagnostic class. The other specified trauma- and stressor-
related disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician

Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder 153
chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation
does not meet the criteria for any specific trauma- and stressor-
related disorder. This is done by recording “other specified trauma-
and stressor-related disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g.,
“persistent complex bereavement disorder”).
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other
specified” designation include the following:
1. Adjustment-like disorders with delayed onset of symptoms
that occur more than 3 months after the stressor.
2. Adjustment-like disorders with prolonged duration of more
than 6 months without prolonged duration of stressor.
3. Ataque de nervios: See “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Dis-
tress” in the Appendix to DSM-5.
4. Other cultural syndromes: See “Glossary of Cultural Concepts
of Distress” in the Appendix to DSM-5.
5. Persistent complex bereavement disorder: This disorder is
characterized by severe and persistent grief and mourning reac-
tions (see the chapter “Conditions for Further Study” in Section
III of DSM-5).
Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder
309.9 (F43.9)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a trauma- and stressor-related disorder that cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other im-
portant areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full cri-
teria for any of the disorders in the trauma- and stressor-related
disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified trauma- and stressor-
related disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician
chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a
specific trauma- and stressor-related disorder, and includes presen-
tations in which there is insufficient information to make a more spe-
cific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

Dissociative
Disorders
Dissociative Identity Disorder
300.14 (F44.81)
A. Disruption of identity characterized by two or more distinct per-
sonality states, which may be described in some cultures as an
experience of possession. The disruption in identity involves
marked discontinuity in sense of self and sense of agency, ac-
companied by related alterations in affect, behavior, conscious-
ness, memory, perception, cognition, and/or sensory-motor func-
tioning. These signs and symptoms may be observed by others
or reported by the individual.
B. Recurrent gaps in the recall of everyday events, important per-
sonal information, and/or traumatic events that are inconsistent
with ordinary forgetting.
C. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The disturbance is not a normal part of a broadly accepted cul-
tural or religious practice.
Note: In children, the symptoms are not better explained by
imaginary playmates or other fantasy play.
E. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of
a substance (e.g., blackouts or chaotic behavior during alcohol
intoxication) or another medical condition (e.g., complex partial
seizures).
155

156 Dissociative Disorders
Dissociative Amnesia
300.12 (F44.0)
A. An inability to recall important autobiographical information, usu-
ally of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is inconsistent with or-
dinary forgetting.
Note: Dissociative amnesia most often consists of localized or
selective amnesia for a specific event or events; or generalized
amnesia for identity and life history.
B. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
C. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of
a substance (e.g., alcohol or other drug of abuse, a medication)
or a neurological or other medical condition (e.g., partial complex
seizures, transient global amnesia, sequelae of a closed head in-
jury/traumatic brain injury, other neurological condition).
D. The disturbance is not better explained by dissociative identity
disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder,
somatic symptom disorder, or major or mild neurocognitive dis-
order.
Coding note: The code for dissociative amnesia without dissociative
fugue is 300.12 (F44.0). The code for dissociative amnesia with dis-
sociative fugue is 300.13 (F44.1).
Specify if:
300.13 (F44.1) With dissociative fugue: Apparently purposeful
travel or bewildered wandering that is associated with amnesia
for identity or for other important autobiographical information.

Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder 157
Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder
300.6 (F48.1)
A. The presence of persistent or recurrent experiences of deper-
sonalization, derealization, or both:
1. Depersonalization: Experiences of unreality, detachment,
or being an outside observer with respect to one’s thoughts,
feelings, sensations, body, or actions (e.g., perceptual alter-
ations, distorted sense of time, unreal or absent self, emo-
tional and/or physical numbing).
2. Derealization: Experiences of unreality or detachment with
respect to surroundings (e.g., individuals or objects are ex-
perienced as unreal, dreamlike, foggy, lifeless, or visually
distorted).
B. During the depersonalization or derealization experiences, reality
testing remains intact.
C. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of
a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, medication) or another med-
ical condition (e.g., seizures).
E. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disor-
der, such as schizophrenia, panic disorder, major depressive
disorder, acute stress disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, or
another dissociative disorder.

158 Dissociative Disorders
Other Specified Dissociative Disorder
300.15 (F44.89)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a dissociative disorder that cause clinically significant distress
or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the dissociative disorders diagnostic class. The other
specified dissociative disorder category is used in situations in which
the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the
presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific dissociative
disorder. This is done by recording “other specified dissociative dis-
order” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “dissociative trance”).
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other
specified” designation include the following:
1. Chronic and recurrent syndromes of mixed dissociative
symptoms: This category includes identity disturbance associ-
ated with less-than-marked discontinuities in sense of self and
agency, or alterations of identity or episodes of possession in an
individual who reports no dissociative amnesia.
2. Identity disturbance due to prolonged and intense coercive
persuasion: Individuals who have been subjected to intense coer-
cive persuasion (e.g., brainwashing, thought reform, indoctrination
while captive, torture, long-term political imprisonment, recruitment
by sects/cults or by terror organizations) may present with pro-
longed changes in, or conscious questioning of, their identity.
3. Acute dissociative reactions to stressful events: This cate-
gory is for acute, transient conditions that typically last less than
1 month, and sometimes only a few hours or days. These condi-
tions are characterized by constriction of consciousness; deper-
sonalization; derealization; perceptual disturbances (e.g., time
slowing, macropsia); micro-amnesias; transient stupor; and/or al-
terations in sensory-motor functioning (e.g., analgesia, paralysis).
4. Dissociative trance: This condition is characterized by an acute
narrowing or complete loss of awareness of immediate surround-
ings that manifests as profound unresponsiveness or insens-
itivity to environmental stimuli. The unresponsiveness may be

Unspecified Dissociative Disorder 159
accompanied by minor stereotyped behaviors (e.g., finger move-
ments) of which the individual is unaware and/or that he or she
cannot control, as well as transient paralysis or loss of con-
sciousness. The dissociative trance is not a normal part of a
broadly accepted collective cultural or religious practice.
Unspecified Dissociative Disorder
300.15 (F44.9)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a dissociative disorder that cause clinically significant distress
or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the dissociative disorders diagnostic class. The unspec-
ified dissociative disorder category is used in situations in which the
clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not
met for a specific dissociative disorder, and includes presentations
for which there is insufficient information to make a more specific di-
agnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

B. Somatic symptoms are not present or, if present, are only mild in
intensity. If another medical condition is present or there is a high
risk for developing a medical condition (e.g., strong family history
is present), the preoccupation is clearly excessive or dispropor-
tionate.
C. There is a high level of anxiety about health, and the individual is
easily alarmed about personal health status.
D. The individual performs excessive health-related behaviors (e.g.,
repeatedly checks his or her body for signs of illness) or exhibits
maladaptive avoidance (e.g., avoids doctor appointments and
hospitals).
E. Illness preoccupation has been present for at least 6 months, but
the specific illness that is feared may change over that period of
time.
F. The illness-related preoccupation is not better explained by an-
other mental disorder, such as somatic symptom disorder, panic
disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, body dysmorphic disor-
der, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or delusional disorder, so-
matic type.
Specify whether:

C. The symptom or deficit is not better explained by another medical
or mental disorder.
D. The symptom or deficit causes clinically significant distress or im-
pairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of func-
tioning or warrants medical evaluation.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code for conversion disorder is 300.11,
which is assigned regardless of the symptom type. The ICD-10-CM
code depends on the symptom type (see below).
Specify symptom type:

present.
B. Psychological or behavioral factors adversely affect the medical
condition in one of the following ways:
1. The factors have influenced the course of the medical condi-
tion as shown by a close temporal association between the
psychological factors and the development or exacerbation

2. The factors interfere with the treatment of the medical condi-
tion (e.g., poor adherence).
3. The factors constitute additional well-established health risks
for the individual.

cipitating or exacerbating symptoms or necessitating medi-
cal attention.
C. The psychological and behavioral factors in Criterion B are not
better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., panic disorder,
major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder).
Specify current severity:
Mild: Increases medical risk (e.g., inconsistent adherence with
antihypertension treatment).
Moderate: Aggravates underlying medical condition (e.g., anxi-
ety aggravating asthma).
Severe: Results in medical hospitalization or emergency room
visit.
Extreme: Results in severe, life-threatening risk (e.g., ignoring
heart attack symptoms).

Single episode
Recurrent episodes (two or more events of falsification of ill-
ness and/or induction of injury)

166 Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders
Recording Procedures
When an individual falsifies illness in another (e.g., children, adults,
pets), the diagnosis is factitious disorder imposed on another. The
perpetrator, not the victim, is given the diagnosis. The victim may be
given an abuse diagnosis (e.g., 995.54 [T74.12X]; see the chapter
“Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention”).
Other Specified Somatic Symptom and
Related Disorder
300.89 (F45.8)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a somatic symptom and related disorder that cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other im-

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a somatic symptom and related disorder that cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other im-
portant areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria
for any of the disorders in the somatic symptom and related disorders
diagnostic class. The unspecified somatic symptom and related disor-
der category should not be used unless there are decidedly unusual
situations where there is insufficient information to make a more spe-
cific diagnosis.

Feeding and
Eating Disorders
Pica
A. Persistent eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances over a pe-
riod of at least 1 month.
B. The eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances is inappropriate
to the developmental level of the individual.
C. The eating behavior is not part of a culturally supported or socially
normative practice.
D. If the eating behavior occurs in the context of another mental
disorder (e.g., intellectual disability [intellectual developmental
disorder], autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia) or medical
condition (including pregnancy), it is sufficiently severe to war-
rant additional clinical attention.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code for pica is 307.52 and is used for
children or adults. The ICD-10-CM codes for pica are (F98.3) in chil-
dren and (F50.8) in adults.
Specify if:

course of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disor-
der, or avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder.
D. If the symptoms occur in the context of another mental disorder
(e.g., intellectual disability [intellectual developmental disorder]
or another neurodevelopmental disorder), they are sufficiently
severe to warrant additional clinical attention.
Specify if:
In remission: After full criteria for rumination disorder were pre-
viously met, the criteria have not been met for a sustained period
of time.
Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder
307.59 (F50.8)
A. An eating or feeding disturbance (e.g., apparent lack of interest in
eating or food; avoidance based on the sensory characteristics of
food; concern about aversive consequences of eating) as mani-
fested by persistent failure to meet appropriate nutritional and/or
energy needs associated with one (or more) of the following:
1. Significant weight loss (or failure to achieve expected weight
gain or faltering growth in children).
2. Significant nutritional deficiency.
3. Dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supple-
ments.
4. Marked interference with psychosocial functioning.
B. The disturbance is not better explained by lack of available food
or by an associated culturally sanctioned practice.
C. The eating disturbance does not occur exclusively during the
course of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, and there is no
evidence of a disturbance in the way in which one’s body weight
or shape is experienced.
D. The eating disturbance is not attributable to a concurrent medical
condition or not better explained by another mental disorder.
When the eating disturbance occurs in the context of another

Anorexia Nervosa 171
condition or disorder, the severity of the eating disturbance ex-
ceeds that routinely associated with the condition or disorder and
warrants additional clinical attention.
Specify if:
In remission: After full criteria for avoidant/restrictive food intake
disorder were previously met, the criteria have not been met for
a sustained period of time.
Anorexia Nervosa
A. Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements, leading
to a significantly low body weight in the context of age, sex, devel-
opmental trajectory, and physical health. Significantly low weight
is defined as a weight that is less than minimally normal or, for chil-
dren and adolescents, less than that minimally expected.
B. Intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent
behavior that interferes with weight gain, even though at a signif-
icantly low weight.
C. Disturbance in the way in which one’s body weight or shape is
experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-
evaluation, or persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of
the current low body weight.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code for anorexia nervosa is 307.1,
which is assigned regardless of the subtype. The ICD-10-CM code
depends on the subtype (see below).
Specify whether:
(F50.01) Restricting type: During the last 3 months, the individ-
ual has not engaged in recurrent episodes of binge eating or
purging behavior (i.e., self-induced vomiting or the misuse of lax-
atives, diuretics, or enemas). This subtype describes presenta-
tions in which weight loss is accomplished primarily through
dieting, fasting, and/or excessive exercise.
(F50.02) Binge-eating/purging type: During the last 3 months,
the individual has engaged in recurrent episodes of binge eating
or purging behavior (i.e., self-induced vomiting or the misuse of
laxatives, diuretics, or enemas).

172 Feeding and Eating Disorders
Specify if:
In partial remission: After full criteria for anorexia nervosa were
previously met, Criterion A (low body weight) has not been met
for a sustained period, but either Criterion B (intense fear of gain-
ing weight or becoming fat or behavior that interferes with weight
gain) or Criterion C (disturbances in self-perception of weight
and shape) is still met.
In full remission: After full criteria for anorexia nervosa were
previously met, none of the criteria have been met for a sus-
tained period of time.
Specify current severity:
The minimum level of severity is based, for adults, on current body
mass index (BMI) (see below) or, for children and adolescents, on
BMI percentile. The ranges below are derived from World Health Or-
ganization categories for thinness in adults; for children and adoles-
cents, corresponding BMI percentiles should be used. The level of
severity may be increased to reflect clinical symptoms, the degree
of functional disability, and the need for supervision.
Mild: BMI ≥ 17 kg/m2
Moderate: BMI 16–16.99 kg/m2
Severe: BMI 15–15.99 kg/m2
Extreme: BMI < 15 kg/m2
Bulimia Nervosa
307.51 (F50.2)
A. Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating
is characterized by both of the following:
1. Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour
period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than what
most individuals would eat in a similar period of time under
similar circumstances.
2. A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode
(e.g., a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or
how much one is eating).

Bulimia Nervosa 173
B. Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors in order to
prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting; misuse of
laxatives, diuretics, or other medications; fasting; or excessive
exercise.
C. The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors
both occur, on average, at least once a week for 3 months.
D. Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight.
E. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of
anorexia nervosa.
Specify if:
In partial remission: After full criteria for bulimia nervosa were
previously met, some, but not all, of the criteria have been met
for a sustained period of time.
In full remission: After full criteria for bulimia nervosa were pre-
viously met, none of the criteria have been met for a sustained
period of time.
Specify current severity:
The minimum level of severity is based on the frequency of inappro-
priate compensatory behaviors (see below). The level of severity
may be increased to reflect other symptoms and the degree of func-
tional disability.
Mild: An average of 1–3 episodes of inappropriate compensa-
tory behaviors per week.
Moderate: An average of 4–7 episodes of inappropriate com-
pensatory behaviors per week.
Severe: An average of 8–13 episodes of inappropriate compen-
satory behaviors per week.
Extreme: An average of 14 or more episodes of inappropriate
compensatory behaviors per week.

174 Feeding and Eating Disorders
Binge-Eating Disorder
307.51 (F50.8)
A. Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating
is characterized by both of the following:
1. Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour
period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than what
most people would eat in a similar period of time under sim-
ilar circumstances.
2. A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode
(e.g., a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or
how much one is eating).
B. The binge-eating episodes are associated with three (or more) of
the following:
1. Eating much more rapidly than normal.
2. Eating until feeling uncomfortably full.
3. Eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically
hungry.
4. Eating alone because of feeling embarrassed by how much
one is eating.
5. Feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed, or very guilty af-
terward.
C. Marked distress regarding binge eating is present.
D. The binge eating occurs, on average, at least once a week for
3 months.
E. The binge eating is not associated with the recurrent use of inap-
propriate compensatory behavior as in bulimia nervosa and does
not occur exclusively during the course of bulimia nervosa or an-
orexia nervosa.
Specify if:
In partial remission: After full criteria for binge-eating disorder
were previously met, binge eating occurs at an average frequency
of less than one episode per week for a sustained period of time.

Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder 175
In full remission: After full criteria for binge-eating disorder were
previously met, none of the criteria have been met for a sus-
tained period of time.
Specify current severity:
The minimum level of severity is based on the frequency of episodes
of binge eating (see below). The level of severity may be increased
to reflect other symptoms and the degree of functional disability.
Mild: 1–3 binge-eating episodes per week.
Moderate: 4–7 binge-eating episodes per week.
Severe: 8–13 binge-eating episodes per week.
Extreme: 14 or more binge-eating episodes per week.
Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder
307.59 (F50.8)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a feeding and eating disorder that cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important ar-
eas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any
of the disorders in the feeding and eating disorders diagnostic class.
The other specified feeding or eating disorder category is used in sit-
uations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific
reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any spe-
cific feeding and eating disorder. This is done by recording “other
specified feeding or eating disorder” followed by the specific reason
(e.g., “bulimia nervosa of low frequency”).
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other
specified” designation include the following:
1. Atypical anorexia nervosa: All of the criteria for anorexia ner-
vosa are met, except that despite significant weight loss, the in-
dividual’s weight is within or above the normal range.
2. Bulimia nervosa (of low frequency and/or limited duration):
All of the criteria for bulimia nervosa are met, except that the
binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors occur,
on average, less than once a week and/or for less than 3 months.

176 Feeding and Eating Disorders
3. Binge-eating disorder (of low frequency and/or limited dura-
tion): All of the criteria for binge-eating disorder are met, except
that the binge eating occurs, on average, less than once a week
and/or for less than 3 months.
4. Purging disorder: Recurrent purging behavior to influence
weight or shape (e.g., self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives,
diuretics, or other medications) in the absence of binge eating.
5. Night eating syndrome: Recurrent episodes of night eating, as
manifested by eating after awakening from sleep or by excessive
food consumption after the evening meal. There is awareness and
recall of the eating. The night eating is not better explained by ex-
ternal influences such as changes in the individual’s sleep-wake
cycle or by local social norms. The night eating causes significant
distress and/or impairment in functioning. The disordered pattern
of eating is not better explained by binge-eating disorder or an-
other mental disorder, including substance use, and is not attribut-
able to another medical disorder or to an effect of medication.
Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder
307.50 (F50.9)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a feeding and eating disorder that cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important ar-
eas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any
of the disorders in the feeding and eating disorders diagnostic class.
The unspecified feeding or eating disorder category is used in situa-
tions in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the
criteria are not met for a specific feeding and eating disorder, and in-
cludes presentations in which there is insufficient information to
make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

Elimination
Disorders
Enuresis
307.6 (F98.0)
A. Repeated voiding of urine into bed or clothes, whether involun-
tary or intentional.
B. The behavior is clinically significant as manifested by either a fre-
quency of at least twice a week for at least 3 consecutive months
or the presence of clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, academic (occupational), or other important areas of
functioning.
C. Chronological age is at least 5 years (or equivalent developmen-
tal level).
D. The behavior is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a diuretic, an antipsychotic medication) or an-
other medical condition (e.g., diabetes, spina bifida, a seizure
disorder).
Specify whether:
Nocturnal only: Passage of urine only during nighttime sleep.
Diurnal only: Passage of urine during waking hours.
Nocturnal and diurnal: A combination of the two subtypes
above.

178 Elimination Disorders
Encopresis
307.7 (F98.1)
A. Repeated passage of feces into inappropriate places (e.g., cloth-
ing, floor), whether involuntary or intentional.
B. At least one such event occurs each month for at least 3 months.
C. Chronological age is at least 4 years (or equivalent developmen-
tal level).
D. The behavior is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., laxatives) or another medical condition except
through a mechanism involving constipation.
Specify whether:
With constipation and overflow incontinence: There is evi-
dence of constipation on physical examination or by history.
Without constipation and overflow incontinence: There is no
evidence of constipation on physical examination or by history.
Other Specified Elimination Disorder
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of an elimination disorder that cause clinically significant distress
or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the elimination disorders diagnostic class. The other
specified elimination disorder category is used in situations in which
the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the
presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific elimination
disorder. This is done by recording “other specified elimination disor-
der” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “low-frequency enuresis”).
Coding note: Code 788.39 (N39.498) for other specified elimination
disorder with urinary symptoms; 787.60 (R15.9) for other specified
elimination disorder with fecal symptoms.

Unspecified Elimination Disorder 179
Unspecified Elimination Disorder
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of an elimination disorder that cause clinically significant distress
or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the elimination disorders diagnostic class. The unspeci-
fied elimination disorder category is used in situations in which the
clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not
met for a specific elimination disorder, and includes presentations in
which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diag-
nosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).
Coding note: Code 788.30 (R32) for unspecified elimination disor-
der with urinary symptoms; 787.60 (R15.9) for unspecified elimina-
tion disorder with fecal symptoms.

cretin deficiency: Criterion B requirements of low CSF hypocre-
tin-1 levels and positive polysomnography/multiple sleep latency
test are met, but no cataplexy is present (Criterion B1 not met).

347.01 (G47.411) Narcolepsy with cataplexy but without
hypocretin deficiency: In this rare subtype (less than 5% of nar-
colepsy cases), Criterion B requirements of cataplexy and posi-
tive polysomnography/multiple sleep latency test are met, but
CSF hypocretin-1 levels are normal (Criterion B2 not met).
347.00 (G47.419) Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia,
deafness, and narcolepsy: This subtype is caused by exon 21
DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase-1 mutations and is charac-
terized by late-onset (age 30–40 years) narcolepsy (with low or
intermediate CSF hypocretin-1 levels), deafness, cerebellar ataxia,
and eventually dementia.
347.00 (G47.419) Autosomal dominant narcolepsy, obesity,
and type 2 diabetes: Narcolepsy, obesity, and type 2 diabetes
and low CSF hypocretin-1 levels have been described in rare
cases and are associated with a mutation in the myelin oligoden-
drocyte glycoprotein gene.
347.10 (G47.429) Narcolepsy secondary to another medical
condition: This subtype is for narcolepsy that develops second-
ary to medical conditions that cause infectious (e.g., Whipple’s
disease, sarcoidosis), traumatic, or tumoral destruction of hypo-
cretin neurons.
Coding note (for ICD-9-CM code 347.10 only): Code first
the underlying medical condition (e.g., 040.2 Whipple’s dis-

327.23 (G47.33)
A. Either (1) or (2):
1. Evidence by polysomnography of at least five obstructive ap-
neas or hypopneas per hour of sleep and either of the follow-
ing sleep symptoms:
a. Nocturnal breathing disturbances: snoring, snorting/
gasping, or breathing pauses during sleep.
b. Daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or unrefreshing sleep despite
sufficient opportunities to sleep that is not better explained
by another mental disorder (including a sleep disorder)
and is not attributable to another medical condition.
2. Evidence by polysomnography of 15 or more obstructive ap-
neas and/or hypopneas per hour of sleep regardless of ac-
companying symptoms.
Specify current severity:
Mild: Apnea hypopnea index is less than 15.
Moderate: Apnea hypopnea index is 15–30.
Severe: Apnea hypopnea index is greater than 30.
Central Sleep Apnea
A. Evidence by polysomnography of five or more central apneas
per hour of sleep.
B. The disorder is not better explained by another current sleep
disorder.
Specify whether:
327.21 (G47.31) Idiopathic central sleep apnea: Characterized
by repeated episodes of apneas and hypopneas during sleep

Sleep-Related Hypoventilation 187
caused by variability in respiratory effort but without evidence of
airway obstruction.
786.04 (R06.3) Cheyne-Stokes breathing: A pattern of periodic
crescendo-decrescendo variation in tidal volume that results in
central apneas and hypopneas at a frequency of at least five
events per hour, accompanied by frequent arousal.
780.57 (G47.37) Central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid
use: The pathogenesis of this subtype is attributed to the effects
of opioids on the respiratory rhythm generators in the medulla as
well as the differential effects on hypoxic versus hypercapnic re-
spiratory drive.
Coding note (for 780.57 [G47.37] code only): When an opioid use
disorder is present, first code the opioid use disorder: 305.50
(F11.10) mild opioid use disorder or 304.00 (F11.20) moderate or se-
vere opioid use disorder; then code 780.57 (G47.37) central sleep
apnea comorbid with opioid use. When an opioid use disorder is not
present (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), code
only 780.57 (G47.37) central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use.
Specify current severity:
Severity of central sleep apnea is graded according to the fre-
quency of the breathing disturbances as well as the extent of as-
sociated oxygen desaturation and sleep fragmentation that occur
as a consequence of repetitive respiratory disturbances.
Sleep-Related Hypoventilation
A. Polysomnograpy demonstrates episodes of decreased respira-
tion associated with elevated CO levels. (Note: In the absence
2
of objective measurement of CO , persistent low levels of hemo-
2
globin oxygen saturation unassociated with apneic/hypopneic
events may indicate hypoventilation.)
B. The disturbance is not better explained by another current sleep
disorder.
Specify whether:
327.24 (G47.34) Idiopathic hypoventilation: This subtype is
not attributable to any readily identified condition.

188 Sleep-Wake Disorders
327.25 (G47.35) Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation:
This subtype is a rare congenital disorder in which the individual
typically presents in the perinatal period with shallow breathing,
or cyanosis and apnea during sleep.
327.26 (G47.36) Comorbid sleep-related hypoventilation: This
subtype occurs as a consequence of a medical condition, such as a
pulmonary disorder (e.g., interstitial lung disease, chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease) or a neuromuscular or chest wall disorder
(e.g., muscular dystrophies, postpolio syndrome, cervical spinal
cord injury, kyphoscoliosis), or medications (e.g., benzodiazepines,
opiates). It also occurs with obesity (obesity hypoventilation disor-
der), where it reflects a combination of increased work of breathing
due to reduced chest wall compliance and ventilation-perfusion mis-
match and variably reduced ventilatory drive. Such individuals usu-
ally are characterized by body mass index of greater than 30 and
hypercapnia during wakefulness (with a pCO of greater than 45),
2
without other evidence of hypoventilation.
Specify current severity:
Severity is graded according to the degree of hypoxemia and hy-
percarbia present during sleep and evidence of end organ im-
pairment due to these abnormalities (e.g., right-sided heart
failure). The presence of blood gas abnormalities during wakeful-
ness is an indicator of greater severity.
Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders
A. A persistent or recurrent pattern of sleep disruption that is primar-
ily due to an alteration of the circadian system or to a misalign-
ment between the endogenous circadian rhythm and the sleep-
wake schedule required by an individual’s physical environment
or social or professional schedule.
B. The sleep disruption leads to excessive sleepiness or insomnia,
or both.
C. The sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or im-
pairment in social, occupational, and other important areas of
functioning.

layed sleep onset and awakening times, with an inability to fall
asleep and awaken at a desired or conventionally acceptable
earlier time.
Specify if:

vanced sleep onset and awakening times, with an inability to re-
main awake or asleep until the desired or conventionally
acceptable later sleep or wake times.
Specify if:
Familial: A family history of advanced sleep phase is present.
307.45 (G47.23) Irregular sleep-wake type: A temporally disor-
ganized sleep-wake pattern, such that the timing of sleep and

307.45 (G47.24) Non-24-hour sleep-wake type: A pattern of
sleep-wake cycles that is not synchronized to the 24-hour envi-
ronment, with a consistent daily drift (usually to later and later
times) of sleep onset and wake times.
307.45 (G47.26) Shift work type: Insomnia during the major
sleep period and/or excessive sleepiness (including inadvertent
sleep) during the major awake period associated with a shift work
schedule (i.e., requiring unconventional work hours).

A. Recurrent episodes of incomplete awakening from sleep, usually
occurring during the first third of the major sleep episode, accom-
panied by either one of the following:
1. Sleepwalking: Repeated episodes of rising from bed during
sleep and walking about. While sleepwalking, the individual
has a blank, staring face; is relatively unresponsive to the ef-
forts of others to communicate with him or her; and can be
awakened only with great difficulty.
2. Sleep terrors: Recurrent episodes of abrupt terror arousals
from sleep, usually beginning with a panicky scream. There
is intense fear and signs of autonomic arousal, such as my-
driasis, tachycardia, rapid breathing, and sweating, during
each episode. There is relative unresponsiveness to efforts
of others to comfort the individual during the episodes.
B. No or little (e.g., only a single visual scene) dream imagery is re-
called.

becomes oriented and alert.
C. The sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or im-
pairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of func-
tioning.

Specify if:
With associated non–sleep disorder, including substance use
disorders
With associated other medical condition
With associated other sleep disorder
Coding note: The code 307.47 (F51.5) applies to all three spec-
ifiers. Code also the relevant associated mental disorder, medi-
cal condition, or other sleep disorder immediately after the code
for nightmare disorder in order to indicate the association.

192 Sleep-Wake Disorders

Subacute: Duration of period of nightmares is greater than 1 month
but less than 6 months.
Persistent: Duration of period of nightmares is 6 months or greater.

Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder
327.42 (G47.52)
A. Repeated episodes of arousal during sleep associated with vo-
calization and/or complex motor behaviors.
B. These behaviors arise during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep
and therefore usually occur more than 90 minutes after sleep on-
set, are more frequent during the later portions of the sleep pe-
riod, and uncommonly occur during daytime naps.
C. Upon awakening from these episodes, the individual is completely
awake, alert, and not confused or disoriented.
D. Either of the following:
1. REM sleep without atonia on polysomnographic recording.
2. A history suggestive of REM sleep behavior disorder and an
established synucleinopathy diagnosis (e.g., Parkinson’s
disease, multiple system atrophy).
E. The behaviors cause clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning
(which may include injury to self or the bed partner).
F. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of
a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another
medical condition.
G. Coexisting mental and medical disorders do not explain the epi-
sodes.

Restless Legs Syndrome 193
Restless Legs Syndrome
333.94 (G25.81)
A. An urge to move the legs, usually accompanied by or in response
to uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs, charac-
terized by all of the following:
1. The urge to move the legs begins or worsens during periods
of rest or inactivity.
2. The urge to move the legs is partially or totally relieved by
movement.
3. The urge to move the legs is worse in the evening or at night
than during the day, or occurs only in the evening or at night.

and have persisted for at least 3 months.
C. The symptoms in Criterion A are accompanied by significant dis-
tress or impairment in social, occupational, educational, aca-
demic, behavioral, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The symptoms in Criterion A are not attributable to another men-
tal disorder or medical condition (e.g., arthritis, leg edema, pe-
ripheral ischemia, leg cramps) and are not better explained by a
behavioral condition (e.g., positional discomfort, habitual foot
tapping).
E. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of
a drug of abuse or medication (e.g., akathisia).
Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder
A. A prominent and severe disturbance in sleep.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or lab-
oratory findings of both (1) and (2):
1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after
substance intoxication or after withdrawal from or exposure
to a medication.
2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing
the symptoms in Criterion A.

194 Sleep-Wake Disorders
C. The disturbance is not better explained by a sleep disorder that
is not substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an inde-
pendent sleep disorder could include the following:
The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medica-
tion use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of
time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute with-
drawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence sug-
gesting the existence of an independent non-substance/
medication-induced sleep disorder (e.g., a history of recur-
rent non-substance/medication-related episodes).
D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of
a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
Note: This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of sub-
stance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptom
in Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and when they are
sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific
substance/medication]-induced sleep disorders are indicated in the ta-
ble below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not
there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class
of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the
substance-induced sleep disorder, the 4th position character is “1,”
and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before
the substance-induced sleep disorder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder
with cocaine-induced sleep disorder”). If a moderate or severe sub-
stance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced sleep dis-
order, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should record
“moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disor-
der” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disor-
der. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-
time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,”
and the clinician should record only the substance-induced sleep dis-
order. A moderate or severe tobacco use disorder is required in order
to code a tobacco-induced sleep disorder; it is not permissible to code
a comorbid mild tobacco use disorder or no tobacco use disorder with
a tobacco-induced sleep disorder.

substance
Specify whether:
Insomnia type: Characterized by difficulty falling asleep or
maintaining sleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, or nonrestor-
ative sleep.
Daytime sleepiness type: Characterized by predominant com-
plaint of excessive sleepiness/fatigue during waking hours or,
less commonly, a long sleep period.
Parasomnia type: Characterized by abnormal behavioral events
during sleep.
Mixed type: Characterized by a substance/medication-induced
sleep problem characterized by multiple types of sleep symp-
toms, but no symptom clearly predominates.
Specify if (see Table 1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addic-
tive Disorders” for diagnoses associated with substance class):

196 Sleep-Wake Disorders
With onset during intoxication: This specifier should be used
if criteria are met for intoxication with the substance/medication
and symptoms developed during the intoxication period.
With onset during discontinuation/withdrawal: This specifier
should be used if criteria are met for discontinuation/withdrawal
from the substance/medication and symptoms developed during,
or shortly after, discontinuation of the substance/medication.
Recording Procedures
ICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced sleep
disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, bupropion)
that is presumed to be causing the sleep disturbance. The diagnostic
code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is
based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the
classes (e.g., bupropion), the code for “other substance” should be
used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological
factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category
“unknown substance” should be used.
The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset
(i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during discontinuation/with-
drawal), followed by the subtype designation (i.e., insomnia type,
daytime sleepiness type, parasomnia type, mixed type). Unlike the
recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the substance-
induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single code, for
ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use
disorder. For example, in the case of insomnia occurring during with-
drawal in a man with a severe lorazepam use disorder, the diagnosis
is 292.85 lorazepam-induced sleep disorder, with onset during with-
drawal, insomnia type. An additional diagnosis of 304.10 severe lo-
razepam use disorder is also given. When more than one substance is
judged to play a significant role in the development of the sleep dis-
turbance, each should be listed separately (e.g., 292.85 alcohol-in-
duced sleep disorder, with onset during intoxication, insomnia type;
292.85 cocaine-induced sleep disorder, with onset during intoxica-
tion, insomnia type).
ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced sleep
disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, bupropion)

Other Specified Insomnia Disorder 197
that is presumed to be causing the sleep disturbance. The diagnostic
code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is
based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid sub-
stance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the
classes (e.g., bupropion), the code for “other substance” should be
used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological
factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “un-
known substance” should be used.
When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid sub-
stance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word
“with,” followed by the name of the substance-induced sleep disor-
der, followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxi-
cation, onset during discontinuation/withdrawal), followed by the
subtype designation (i.e., insomnia type, daytime sleepiness type,
parasomnia type, mixed type). For example, in the case of insomnia
occurring during withdrawal in a man with a severe lorazepam use
disorder, the diagnosis is F13.282 severe lorazepam use disorder with
lorazepam-induced sleep disorder, with onset during withdrawal,
insomnia type. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe loraze-
pam use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced sleep disor-
der occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., with
medication use), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted
(e.g., F19.982 bupropion-induced sleep disorder, with onset during
medication use, insomnia type). When more than one substance is
judged to play a significant role in the development of the sleep dis-
turbance, each should be listed separately (e.g., F10.282 severe alco-
hol use disorder with alcohol-induced sleep disorder, with onset
during intoxication, insomnia type; F14.282 severe cocaine use disor-
der with cocaine-induced sleep disorder, with onset during intoxica-
tion, insomnia type).
Other Specified Insomnia Disorder
780.52 (G47.09)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of insomnia disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of func-
tioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for insomnia dis-

order or any of the disorders in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic
class. The other specified insomnia disorder category is used in situ-
ations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific
reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for insomnia
disorder or any specific sleep-wake disorder. This is done by record-
ing “other specified insomnia disorder” followed by the specific rea-
son (e.g., “brief insomnia disorder”).
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other
specified” designation include the following:
1. Brief insomnia disorder: Duration is less than 3 months.
2. Restricted to nonrestorative sleep: Predominant complaint is
nonrestorative sleep unaccompanied by other sleep symptoms
such as difficulty falling asleep or remaining asleep.
Unspecified Insomnia Disorder
780.52 (G47.00)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of insomnia disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of func-
tioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for insomnia dis-
order or any of the disorders in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic
class. The unspecified insomnia disorder category is used in situa-
tions in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the
criteria are not met for insomnia disorder or a specific sleep-wake
disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient in-
formation to make a more specific diagnosis.
Other Specified Hypersomnolence Disorder
780.54 (G47.19)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of hypersomnolence disorder that cause clinically significant dis-
tress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for hyper-

Unspecified Hypersomnolence Disorder 199
somnolence disorder or any of the disorders in the sleep-wake disor-
ders diagnostic class. The other specified hypersomnolence disorder
category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to com-
municate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the
criteria for hypersomnolence disorder or any specific sleep-wake dis-
order. This is done by recording “other specified hypersomnolence
disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “brief-duration hyper-
somnolence,” as in Kleine-Levin syndrome).
Unspecified Hypersomnolence Disorder
780.54 (G47.10)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of hypersomnolence disorder that cause clinically significant dis-
tress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for hyper-
somnolence disorder or any of the disorders in the sleep-wake disor-
ders diagnostic class. The unspecified hypersomnolence disorder
category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to
specify the reason that the criteria are not met for hypersomnolence
disorder or a specific sleep-wake disorder, and includes presenta-
tions in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific
diagnosis.
Other Specified Sleep-Wake Disorder
780.59 (G47.8)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a sleep-wake disorder that cause clinically significant distress
or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic class and do not
qualify for a diagnosis of other specified insomnia disorder or other
specified hypersomnolence disorder. The other specified sleep-wake
disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses

200 Sleep-Wake Disorders
to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not
meet the criteria for any specific sleep-wake disorder. This is done by
recording “other specified sleep-wake disorder” followed by the spe-
cific reason (e.g., “repeated arousals during rapid eye movement
sleep without polysomnography or history of Parkinson’s disease or
other synucleinopathy”).
Unspecified Sleep-Wake Disorder
780.59 (G47.9)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a sleep-wake disorder that cause clinically significant distress
or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic class and do not
qualify for a diagnosis of unspecified insomnia disorder or unspeci-
fied hypersomnolence disorder. The unspecified sleep-wake disor-
der category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not
to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific sleep-
wake disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insuffi-
cient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Substance/Medication-Induced
Sexual Dysfunction
A. A clinically significant disturbance in sexual function is predomi-
nant in the clinical picture.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or lab-
oratory findings of both (1) and (2):

Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction 209
1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after
substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a
medication.
2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing
the symptoms in Criterion A.
C. The disturbance is not better explained by a sexual dysfunction
that is not substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an
independent sexual dysfunction could include the following:
The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medica-
tion use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of
time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute with-
drawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence sug-
gesting the existence of an independent non-substance/
medication-induced sexual dysfunction (e.g., a history of re-
current non-substance/medication-related episodes).
D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of
a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress in the indi-
vidual.
Note: This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of sub-
stance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms
in Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and are sufficiently
severe to warrant clinical attention.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific
substance/medication]-induced sexual dysfunctions are indicated in
the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether
or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same
class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with
the substance-induced sexual dysfunction, the 4th position character
is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder”
before the substance-induced sexual dysfunction (e.g., “mild cocaine
use disorder with cocaine-induced sexual dysfunction”). If a moderate
or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-
induced sexual dysfunction, the 4th position character is “2,” and the
clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe
[substance] use disorder” depending on the severity of the comorbid
substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disor-

210 Sexual Dysfunctions
der (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th
position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the sub-
stance-induced sexual dysfunction.

Specify if (see Table 1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive
Disorders” in DSM-5 for diagnoses associated with substance class):
With onset during intoxication: If the criteria are met for intox-
ication with the substance and the symptoms develop during in-
toxication.
With onset during withdrawal: If criteria are met for withdrawal
from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly
after, withdrawal.
With onset after medication use: Symptoms may appear either
at initiation of medication or after a modification or change in use.
Specify current severity:
Mild: Occurs on 25%–50% of occasions of sexual activity.
Moderate: Occurs on 50%–75% of occasions of sexual activity.
Severe: Occurs on 75% or more of occasions of sexual activity.

Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction 211
Recording Procedures
ICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced sexual
dysfunction begins with the specific substance (e.g., alcohol, fluox-
etine) that is presumed to be causing the sexual dysfunction. The di-
agnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set,
which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into
any of the classes (e.g., fluoxetine), the code for “other substance”
should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an
etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the
category “unknown substance” should be used.
The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset
(i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset
after medication use), followed by the severity specifier (e.g., mild,
moderate, severe). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM,
which combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use
disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code
is given for the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of
erectile dysfunction occurring during intoxication in a man with a se-
vere alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis is 291.89 alcohol-induced
sexual dysfunction, with onset during intoxication, moderate. An ad-
ditional diagnosis of 303.90 severe alcohol use disorder is also given.
When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in
the development of the sexual dysfunction, each should be listed
separately (e.g., 292.89 cocaine-induced sexual dysfunction with onset
during intoxication, moderate; 292.89 fluoxetine-induced sexual dys-
function, with onset after medication use).
ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced sex-
ual dysfunction begins with the specific substance (e.g., alcohol,
fluoxetine) that is presumed to be causing the sexual dysfunction.
The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria
set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a co-
morbid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into
any of the classes (e.g., fluoxetine), the code for “other substance”
should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an
etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the
category “unknown substance” should be used.

212 Sexual Dysfunctions
When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance
use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word “with,” fol-
lowed by the name of the substance-induced sexual dysfunction,
followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication,
onset during withdrawal, with onset after medication use), followed
by the severity specifier (e.g., mild, moderate, severe). For example,
in the case of erectile dysfunction occurring during intoxication in a
man with a severe alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis is F10.281 mod-
erate alcohol use disorder with alcohol-induced sexual dysfunction,
with onset during intoxication, moderate. A separate diagnosis of the
comorbid severe alcohol use disorder is not given. If the substance-
induced sexual dysfunction occurs without a comorbid substance
use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no ac-
companying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F15.981 amphet-
amine-induced sexual dysfunction, with onset during intoxication).
When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in
the development of the sexual dysfunction, each should be listed sep-
arately (e.g., F14.181 mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced
sexual dysfunction, with onset during intoxication, moderate; F19.981
fluoxetine-induced sexual dysfunction, with onset after medication
use, moderate).
Other Specified Sexual Dysfunction
302.79 (F52.8)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a sexual dysfunction that cause clinically significant distress
in the individual predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of
the disorders in the sexual dysfunctions diagnostic class. The other
specified sexual dysfunction category is used in situations in which
the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the
presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific sexual dys-
function. This is done by recording “other specified sexual dysfunction”
followed by the specific reason (e.g., “sexual aversion”).

Unspecified Sexual Dysfunction 213
Unspecified Sexual Dysfunction
302.70 (F52.9)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a sexual dysfunction that cause clinically significant distress in
the individual predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of
the disorders in the sexual dysfunctions diagnostic class. The unspec-
ified sexual dysfunction category is used in situations in which the cli-
nician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met
for a specific sexual dysfunction, and includes presentations for which
there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

rejection of typically feminine toys, games, and activities.
7. A strong dislike of one’s sexual anatomy.
8. A strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex charac-
teristics that match one’s experienced gender.
B. The condition is associated with clinically significant distress or im-
pairment in social, school, or other important areas of functioning.
215

216 Gender Dysphoria
Specify if:
With a disorder of sex development (e.g., a congenital adre-
nogenital disorder such as 255.2 [E25.0] congenital adrenal hy-
perplasia or 259.50 [E34.50] androgen insensitivity syndrome).
Coding note: Code the disorder of sex development as well
as gender dysphoria.
Gender Dysphoria in
Adolescents and Adults 302.85 (F64.1)
A. A marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed
gender and assigned gender, of at least 6 months’ duration, as
manifested by at least two of the following:
1. A marked incongruence between one’s experienced/
expressed gender and primary and/or secondary sex char-
acteristics (or in young adolescents, the anticipated second-
ary sex characteristics).
2. A strong desire to be rid of one’s primary and/or secondary
sex characteristics because of a marked incongruence with
one’s experienced/expressed gender (or in young adoles-
cents, a desire to prevent the development of the anticipated
secondary sex characteristics).
3. A strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex charac-
teristics of the other gender.
4. A strong desire to be of the other gender (or some alternative
gender different from one’s assigned gender).
5. A strong desire to be treated as the other gender (or some
alternative gender different from one’s assigned gender).
6. A strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and re-
actions of the other gender (or some alternative gender dif-
ferent from one’s assigned gender).
B. The condition is associated with clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning.

Other Specified Gender Dysphoria 217
Specify if:
With a disorder of sex development (e.g., a congenital adre-
nogenital disorder such as 255.2 [E25.0] congenital adrenal hy-
perplasia or 259.50 [E34.50] androgen insensitivity syndrome).
Coding note: Code the disorder of sex development as well
as gender dysphoria.
Specify if:
Posttransition: The individual has transitioned to full-time living
in the desired gender (with or without legalization of gender
change) and has undergone (or is preparing to have) at least one
cross-sex medical procedure or treatment regimen—namely,
regular cross-sex hormone treatment or gender reassignment
surgery confirming the desired gender (e.g., penectomy, vagino-
plasty in a natal male; mastectomy or phalloplasty in a natal fe-
male).
Other Specified Gender Dysphoria
302.6 (F64.8)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of gender dysphoria that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of func-
tioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for gender dys-
phoria. The other specified gender dysphoria category is used in
situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific
reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for gender
dysphoria. This is done by recording “other specified gender dyspho-
ria” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “brief gender dysphoria”).
An example of a presentation that can be specified using the
“other specified” designation is the following:
The current disturbance meets symptom criteria for gender
dysphoria, but the duration is less than 6 months.

218 Gender Dysphoria
Unspecified Gender Dysphoria
302.6 (F64.9)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of gender dysphoria that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for gender
dysphoria. The unspecified gender dysphoria category is used in sit-
uations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that
the criteria are not met for gender dysphoria, and includes presenta-
tions in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific
diagnosis.

Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and
Conduct Disorders
Oppositional Defiant Disorder
313.81 (F91.3)
A. A pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behav-
ior, or vindictiveness lasting at least 6 months as evidenced by at
least four symptoms from any of the following categories, and ex-
hibited during interaction with at least one individual who is not a
sibling.
Angry/Irritable Mood
1. Often loses temper.
2. Is often touchy or easily annoyed.
3. Is often angry and resentful.
Argumentative/Defiant Behavior
4. Often argues with authority figures or, for children and ado-
lescents, with adults.
5. Often actively defies or refuses to comply with requests from
authority figures or with rules.
6. Often deliberately annoys others.
7. Often blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior.
Vindictiveness
8. Has been spiteful or vindictive at least twice within the past
6 months.
Note: The persistence and frequency of these behaviors should
be used to distinguish a behavior that is within normal limits from
a behavior that is symptomatic. For children younger than 5 years,
the behavior should occur on most days for a period of at least
6 months, unless otherwise noted (Criterion A8). For individuals
5 years or older, the behavior should occur at least once per week
219

220 Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders
for at least 6 months, unless otherwise noted (Criterion A8). While
these frequency criteria provide guidance on a minimal level of fre-
quency to define symptoms, other factors should also be consid-
ered, such as whether the frequency and intensity of the behaviors
are outside a range that is normative for the individual’s develop-
mental level, gender, and culture.
B. The disturbance in behavior is associated with distress in the in-
dividual or others in his or her immediate social context (e.g.,
family, peer group, work colleagues), or it impacts negatively on
social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning.
C. The behaviors do not occur exclusively during the course of a psy-
chotic, substance use, depressive, or bipolar disorder. Also, the
criteria are not met for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.
Specify current severity:
Mild: Symptoms are confined to only one setting (e.g., at home,
at school, at work, with peers).
Moderate: Some symptoms are present in at least two settings.
Severe: Some symptoms are present in three or more settings.
Intermittent Explosive Disorder
312.34 (F63.81)
A. Recurrent behavioral outbursts representing a failure to control
aggressive impulses as manifested by either of the following:
1. Verbal aggression (e.g., temper tantrums, tirades, verbal ar-
guments or fights) or physical aggression toward property,
animals, or other individuals, occurring twice weekly, on aver-
age, for a period of 3 months. The physical aggression does
not result in damage or destruction of property and does not
result in physical injury to animals or other individuals.
2. Three behavioral outbursts involving damage or destruction
of property and/or physical assault involving physical injury
against animals or other individuals occurring within a 12-
month period.

Conduct Disorder 221
B. The magnitude of aggressiveness expressed during the recur-
rent outbursts is grossly out of proportion to the provocation or to
any precipitating psychosocial stressors.
C. The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not premeditated (i.e., they
are impulsive and/or anger-based) and are not committed to
achieve some tangible objective (e.g., money, power, intimidation).
D. The recurrent aggressive outbursts cause either marked distress in
the individual or impairment in occupational or interpersonal func-
tioning, or are associated with financial or legal consequences.
E. Chronological age is at least 6 years (or equivalent developmen-
tal level).
F. The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not better explained by
another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder, bipolar
disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, a psychotic dis-
order, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disor-
der) and are not attributable to another medical condition (e.g.,
head trauma, Alzheimer’s disease) or to the physiological effects
of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication). For children
ages 6–18 years, aggressive behavior that occurs as part of an ad-
justment disorder should not be considered for this diagnosis.
Note: This diagnosis can be made in addition to the diagnosis of at-
tention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional
defiant disorder, or autism spectrum disorder when recurrent impul-
sive aggressive outbursts are in excess of those usually seen in
these disorders and warrant independent clinical attention.
Conduct Disorder
A. A repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic
rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are
violated, as manifested by the presence of at least three of the fol-
lowing 15 criteria in the past 12 months from any of the categories
below, with at least one criterion present in the past 6 months:
Aggression to People and Animals
1. Often bullies, threatens, or intimidates others.
2. Often initiates physical fights.

222 Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders
3. Has used a weapon that can cause serious physical harm to
others (e.g., a bat, brick, broken bottle, knife, gun).
4. Has been physically cruel to people.
5. Has been physically cruel to animals.
6. Has stolen while confronting a victim (e.g., mugging, purse
snatching, extortion, armed robbery).
7. Has forced someone into sexual activity.
Destruction of Property
8. Has deliberately engaged in fire setting with the intention of
causing serious damage.
9. Has deliberately destroyed others’ property (other than by
fire setting).
Deceitfulness or Theft
10. Has broken into someone else’s house, building, or car.
11. Often lies to obtain goods or favors or to avoid obligations
(i.e., “cons” others).
12. Has stolen items of nontrivial value without confronting a vic-
tim (e.g., shoplifting, but without breaking and entering; forg-
ery).
Serious Violations of Rules
13. Often stays out at night despite parental prohibitions, begin-
ning before age 13 years.
14. Has run away from home overnight at least twice while living
in the parental or parental surrogate home, or once without
returning for a lengthy period.
15. Is often truant from school, beginning before age 13 years.
B. The disturbance in behavior causes clinically significant impair-
ment in social, academic, or occupational functioning.
C. If the individual is age 18 years or older, criteria are not met for
antisocial personality disorder.
Specify whether:
312.81 (F91.1) Childhood-onset type: Individuals show at least
one symptom characteristic of conduct disorder prior to age
10 years.

Conduct Disorder 223
312.82 (F91.2) Adolescent-onset type: Individuals show no
symptom characteristic of conduct disorder prior to age 10 years.
312.89 (F91.9) Unspecified onset: Criteria for a diagnosis of
conduct disorder are met, but there is not enough information
available to determine whether the onset of the first symptom
was before or after age 10 years.
Specify if:
With limited prosocial emotions: To qualify for this specifier, an
individual must have displayed at least two of the following char-
acteristics persistently over at least 12 months and in multiple
relationships and settings. These characteristics reflect the indi-
vidual’s typical pattern of interpersonal and emotional functioning
over this period and not just occasional occurrences in some sit-
uations. Thus, to assess the criteria for the specifier, multiple in-
formation sources are necessary. In addition to the individual’s
self-report, it is necessary to consider reports by others who have
known the individual for extended periods of time (e.g., parents,
teachers, co-workers, extended family members, peers).
Lack of remorse or guilt: Does not feel bad or guilty when
he or she does something wrong (exclude remorse when ex-
pressed only when caught and/or facing punishment). The
individual shows a general lack of concern about the nega-
tive consequences of his or her actions. For example, the in-
dividual is not remorseful after hurting someone or does not
care about the consequences of breaking rules.
Callous—lack of empathy: Disregards and is unconcerned
about the feelings of others. The individual is described as
cold and uncaring. The person appears more concerned
about the effects of his or her actions on himself or herself,
rather than their effects on others, even when they result in
substantial harm to others.
Unconcerned about performance: Does not show concern
about poor/problematic performance at school, at work, or in
other important activities. The individual does not put forth
the effort necessary to perform well, even when expectations
are clear, and typically blames others for his or her poor per-
formance.

224 Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders
Shallow or deficient affect: Does not express feelings or
show emotions to others, except in ways that seem shallow,
insincere, or superficial (e.g., actions contradict the emotion
displayed; can turn emotions “on” or “off” quickly) or when
emotional expressions are used for gain (e.g., emotions dis-
played to manipulate or intimidate others).
Specify current severity:
Mild: Few if any conduct problems in excess of those required to
make the diagnosis are present, and conduct problems cause
relatively minor harm to others (e.g., lying, truancy, staying out
after dark without permission, other rule breaking).
Moderate: The number of conduct problems and the effect on oth-
ers are intermediate between those specified in “mild” and those
in “severe” (e.g., stealing without confronting a victim, vandalism).
Severe: Many conduct problems in excess of those required to
make the diagnosis are present, or conduct problems cause consid-
erable harm to others (e.g., forced sex, physical cruelty, use of a
weapon, stealing while confronting a victim, breaking and entering).
Antisocial Personality Disorder
Criteria for antisocial personality disorder can be found in the chap-
ter “Personality Disorders.” Because this disorder is closely con-
nected to the spectrum of “externalizing” conduct disorders in this
chapter, as well as to the disorders in the adjoining chapter “Sub-
stance-Related and Addictive Disorders,” it is listed here, and the cri-
teria are presented in the chapter “Personality Disorders.”
Pyromania
312.33 (F63.1)
A. Deliberate and purposeful fire setting on more than one occasion.
B. Tension or affective arousal before the act.
C. Fascination with, interest in, curiosity about, or attraction to fire
and its situational contexts (e.g., paraphernalia, uses, conse-
quences).

Kleptomania 225
D. Pleasure, gratification, or relief when setting fires or when wit-
nessing or participating in their aftermath.
E. The fire setting is not done for monetary gain, as an expression of
sociopolitical ideology, to conceal criminal activity, to express anger
or vengeance, to improve one’s living circumstances, in response
to a delusion or hallucination, or as a result of impaired judgment
(e.g., in major neurocognitive disorder, intellectual disability [intel-
lectual developmental disorder], substance intoxication).
F. The fire setting is not better explained by conduct disorder, a
manic episode, or antisocial personality disorder.
Kleptomania
312.32 (F63.2)
A. Recurrent failure to resist impulses to steal objects that are not
needed for personal use or for their monetary value.
B. Increasing sense of tension immediately before committing the
theft.
C. Pleasure, gratification, or relief at the time of committing the theft.
D. The stealing is not committed to express anger or vengeance
and is not in response to a delusion or a hallucination.
E. The stealing is not better explained by conduct disorder, a manic
episode, or antisocial personality disorder.
Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and
Conduct Disorder
312.89 (F91.8)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder that cause
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the
full criteria for any of the disorders in the disruptive, impulse-control,
and conduct disorders diagnostic class. The other specified disrup-
tive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder category is used in situa-

226 Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders
tions in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific
reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any spe-
cific disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder. This is done
by recording “other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and con-
duct disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “recurrent behav-
ioral outbursts of insufficient frequency”).
Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control,
and Conduct Disorder
312.9 (F91.9)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder that cause
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the
full criteria for any of the disorders in the disruptive, impulse-control,
and conduct disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified disruptive,
impulse-control, and conduct disorder category is used in situations
in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the crite-
ria are not met for a specific disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct
disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient in-
formation to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency
room settings).

Substance-Related and
Addictive Disorders
The substance-related disorders encompass 10 separate
classes of drugs: alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; hallucinogens (with sep-
arate categories for phencyclidine [or similarly acting arylcyclohex-
ylamines] and other hallucinogens); inhalants; opioids; sedatives,
hypnotics, and anxiolytics; stimulants (amphetamine-type sub-
stances, cocaine, and other stimulants); tobacco; and other (or un-
known) substances. These 10 classes are not fully distinct. All drugs
that are taken in excess have in common direct activation of the brain
reward system, which is involved in the reinforcement of behaviors
and the production of memories. They produce such an intense acti-
vation of the reward system that normal activities may be neglected.
In addition to the substance-related disorders, this chapter also
includes gambling disorder, reflecting evidence that gambling be-
haviors activate reward systems similar to those activated by drugs
of abuse and produce some behavioral symptoms that appear com-
parable to the substance use disorders.
The substance-related disorders are divided into two groups:
substance use disorders and substance-induced disorders. The fol-
lowing conditions may be classified as substance-induced: intoxica-
tion, withdrawal, and other substance/medication-induced mental
disorders (psychotic disorders, bipolar and related disorders, de-
pressive disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive and re-
lated disorders, sleep disorders, sexual dysfunctions, delirium, and
neurocognitive disorders).
Reflecting some unique aspects of the 10 substance classes rele-
vant to this chapter, the remainder of the chapter is organized by the
class of substance. To facilitate differential diagnosis, the criteria for
the substance/medication-induced mental disorders are included
with disorders with which they share phenomenology (e.g., sub-
stance/medication-induced depressive disorder is in the chapter
“Depressive Disorders”). The broad diagnostic categories associated
with each specific group of substances are shown in the Table 1.

230 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
Substance-Related Disorders
Substance Use Disorders
Recording Procedures for
Substance Use Disorders
The clinician should use the code that applies to the class of substances
but record the name of the specific substance. For example, the clinician
should record 304.10 (F13.20) moderate alprazolam use disorder (rather
than moderate sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder) or 305.70
(F15.10) mild methamphetamine use disorder (rather than mild stimu-
lant use disorder). For substances that do not fit into any of the classes
(e.g., anabolic steroids), the appropriate code for “other substance use
disorder” should be used and the specific substance indicated (e.g.,
305.90 [F19.10] mild anabolic steroid use disorder). If the substance
taken by the individual is unknown, the code for the class “other (or un-
known)” should be used (e.g., 304.90 [F19.20] severe unknown sub-
stance use disorder). If criteria are met for more than one substance use
disorder, all should be diagnosed (e.g., 304.00 [F11.20] severe heroin use
disorder; 304.20 [F14.20] moderate cocaine use disorder).
The appropriate ICD-10-CM code for a substance use disorder
depends on whether there is a comorbid substance-induced disorder
(including intoxication and withdrawal). In the above example, the
diagnostic code for moderate alprazolam use disorder, F13.20, re-
flects the absence of a comorbid alprazolam-induced mental disor-
der. Because ICD-10-CM codes for substance-induced disorders in-
dicate both the presence (or absence) and severity of the substance use
disorder, ICD-10-CM codes for substance use disorders can be used
only in the absence of a substance-induced disorder. See the individual
substance-specific sections for additional coding information.
Note that the word addiction is not applied as a diagnostic term in
this classification, although it is in common usage in many countries
to describe severe problems related to compulsive and habitual use
of substances. The more neutral term substance use disorder is used to
describe the wide range of the disorder, from a mild form to a severe

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders 231
state of chronically relapsing, compulsive drug taking. Some clini-
cians will choose to use the word addiction to describe more extreme
presentations, but the word is omitted from the official DSM-5 sub-
stance use disorder diagnostic terminology because of its uncertain
definition and its potentially negative connotation.
Substance-Induced Disorders
Recording Procedures for
Intoxication and Withdrawal
The clinician should use the code that applies to the class of substances
but record the name of the specific substance. For example, the clinician
should record 292.0 (F13.239) secobarbital withdrawal (rather than
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal) or 292.89 (F15.129) meth-
amphetamine intoxication (rather than stimulant intoxication). Note
that the appropriate ICD-10-CM diagnostic code for intoxication de-
pends on whether there is a comorbid substance use disorder. In this
case, the F15.129 code for methamphetamine indicates the presence of
a comorbid mild methamphetamine use disorder. If there had been no
comorbid methamphetamine use disorder, the diagnostic code would
have been F15.929. ICD-10-CM coding rules require that all with-
drawal codes imply a comorbid moderate to severe substance use dis-
order for that substance. In the above case, the code for secobarbital
withdrawal (F13.239) indicates the comorbid presence of a moderate
to severe secobarbital use disorder. See the coding note for the sub-
stance-specific intoxication and withdrawal syndromes for the actual
coding options.
For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., anabolic
steroids), the appropriate code for “other substance intoxication”
should be used and the specific substance indicated (e.g., 292.89
[F19.929] anabolic steroid intoxication). If the substance taken by the
individual is unknown, the code for the class “other (or unknown)”
should be used (e.g., 292.89 [F19.929] unknown substance intoxica-
tion). If there are symptoms or problems associated with a particular
substance but criteria are not met for any of the substance-specific
disorders, the unspecified category can be used (e.g., 292.9 [F12.99]
unspecified cannabis-related disorder).

232 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
As noted above, the substance-related codes in ICD-10-CM com-
bine the substance use disorder aspect of the clinical picture and the
substance-induced aspect into a single combined code. Thus, if both
heroin withdrawal and moderate heroin use disorder are present, the
single code F11.23 is given to cover both presentations. In ICD-9-CM,
separate diagnostic codes (292.0 and 304.00) are given to indicate with-
drawal and a moderate heroin use disorder, respectively. See the indi-
vidual substance-specific sections for additional coding information.
Recording Procedures for Substance/
Medication-Induced Mental Disorders
Coding notes and separate recording procedures for ICD-9-CM and
ICD-10-CM codes for other specific substance/medication-induced
mental disorders are provided in other chapters of the manual with
disorders with which they share phenomenology (see the substance/
medication-induced mental disorders in these chapters: “Schizophrenia
Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders,” “Bipolar and Related Dis-
orders,” “Depressive Disorders,” “Anxiety Disorders,” “Obsessive-
Compulsive and Related Disorders,” “Sleep-Wake Disorders,” “Sexual
Dysfunctions,” and “Neurocognitive Disorders”). Generally, for ICD-9-
CM, if a mental disorder is induced by a substance use disorder, a sep-
arate diagnostic code is given for the specific substance use disorder, in
addition to the code for the substance/medication-induced mental dis-
order. For ICD-10-CM, a single code combines the substance-induced
mental disorder with the substance use disorder. A separate diagnosis
of the comorbid substance use disorder is not given, although the name
and severity of the specific substance use disorder (when present) are
used when recording the substance/medication-induced mental dis-
order. ICD-10-CM codes are also provided for situations in which the
substance/medication-induced mental disorder is not induced by a
substance use disorder (e.g., when a disorder is induced by one-time use
of a substance or medication). Additional information needed to record
the diagnostic name of the substance/medication-induced mental dis-
order is provided in the section “Recording Procedures” for each sub-
stance/medication-induced mental disorder in its respective chapter.

Alcohol Use Disorder 233
Alcohol-Related Disorders
Alcohol Use Disorder
A. A problematic pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically signifi-
cant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the
following, occurring within a 12-month period:
1. Alcohol is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer pe-
riod than was intended.
2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut
down or control alcohol use.
3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain
alcohol, use alcohol, or recover from its effects.
4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol.
5. Recurrent alcohol use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role
obligations at work, school, or home.
6. Continued alcohol use despite having persistent or recurrent
social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by
the effects of alcohol.
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are
given up or reduced because of alcohol use.
8. Recurrent alcohol use in situations in which it is physically
hazardous.
9. Alcohol use is continued despite knowledge of having a per-
sistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is
likely to have been caused or exacerbated by alcohol.
10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
a. A need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol to
achieve intoxication or desired effect.
b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the
same amount of alcohol.

234 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:
a. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for alcohol
(refer to Criteria A and B of the criteria set for alcohol
withdrawal, pp. 235–236).
b. Alcohol (or a closely related substance, such as a ben-
zodiazepine) is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal
symptoms.
Specify if:
In early remission: After full criteria for alcohol use disorder
were previously met, none of the criteria for alcohol use disorder
have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months
(with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire
or urge to use alcohol,” may be met).
In sustained remission: After full criteria for alcohol use disor-
der were previously met, none of the criteria for alcohol use dis-
order have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or
longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong
desire or urge to use alcohol,” may be met).
Specify if:
In a controlled environment: This additional specifier is used if the
individual is in an environment where access to alcohol is restricted.
Code based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If an al-
cohol intoxication, alcohol withdrawal, or another alcohol-induced
mental disorder is also present, do not use the codes below for alcohol
use disorder. Instead, the comorbid alcohol use disorder is indicated in
the 4th character of the alcohol-induced disorder code (see the coding
note for alcohol intoxication, alcohol withdrawal, or a specific alcohol-
induced mental disorder). For example, if there is comorbid alcohol in-
toxication and alcohol use disorder, only the alcohol intoxication code
is given, with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid alcohol
use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe: F10.129 for mild alcohol use
disorder with alcohol intoxication or F10.229 for a moderate or severe
alcohol use disorder with alcohol intoxication.
Specify current severity:
305.00 (F10.10) Mild: Presence of 2–3 symptoms.
303.90 (F10.20) Moderate: Presence of 4–5 symptoms.
303.90 (F10.20) Severe: Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Alcohol Intoxication 235
Alcohol Intoxication
A. Recent ingestion of alcohol.
B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological
changes (e.g., inappropriate sexual or aggressive behavior, mood
lability, impaired judgment) that developed during, or shortly af-
ter, alcohol ingestion.
C. One (or more) of the following signs or symptoms developing
during, or shortly after, alcohol use:
1. Slurred speech.
2. Incoordination.
3. Unsteady gait.
4. Nystagmus.
5. Impairment in attention or memory.
6. Stupor or coma.
D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disor-
der, including intoxication with another substance.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 303.00. The ICD-10-CM code
depends on whether there is a comorbid alcohol use disorder. If a
mild alcohol use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is
F10.129, and if a moderate or severe alcohol use disorder is comor-
bid, the ICD-10-CM code is F10.229. If there is no comorbid alcohol
use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F10.929.
Alcohol Withdrawal
A. Cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol use that has been heavy
and prolonged.
B. Two (or more) of the following, developing within several hours
to a few days after the cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol use
described in Criterion A:
1. Autonomic hyperactivity (e.g., sweating or pulse rate greater
than 100 bpm).
2. Increased hand tremor.

236 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
3. Insomnia.
4. Nausea or vomiting.
5. Transient visual, tactile, or auditory hallucinations or illu-
sions.
6. Psychomotor agitation.
7. Anxiety.
8. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important
areas of functioning.
D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disor-
der, including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance.
Specify if:
With perceptual disturbances: This specifier applies in the rare
instance when hallucinations (usually visual or tactile) occur with
intact reality testing, or auditory, visual, or tactile illusions occur
in the absence of a delirium.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 291.81. The ICD-10-CM code
for alcohol withdrawal without perceptual disturbances is F10.239,
and the ICD-10-CM code for alcohol withdrawal with perceptual dis-
turbances is F10.232. Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates the
comorbid presence of a moderate or severe alcohol use disorder,
reflecting the fact that alcohol withdrawal can only occur in the
presence of a moderate or severe alcohol use disorder. It is not per-
missible to code a comorbid mild alcohol use disorder with alcohol
withdrawal.
Other Alcohol-Induced Disorders
The following alcohol-induced disorders are described in other chap-
ters of the book with disorders with which they share phenomenol-
ogy (see the substance/medication-induced mental disorders in these
chapters): alcohol-induced psychotic disorder (“Schizophrenia Spec-
trum and Other Psychotic Disorders”); alcohol-induced bipolar dis-
order (“Bipolar and Related Disorders”); alcohol-induced depressive

Unspecified Alcohol-Related Disorder 237
disorder (“Depressive Disorders”); alcohol-induced anxiety disorder
(“Anxiety Disorders”); alcohol-induced sleep disorder (“Sleep-Wake
Disorders”); alcohol-induced sexual dysfunction (“Sexual Dysfunc-
tions”); and alcohol-induced major or mild neurocognitive disorder
(“Neurocognitive Disorders”). For alcohol intoxication delirium and
alcohol withdrawal delirium, see the criteria and discussion of delir-
ium in the chapter “Neurocognitive Disorders.” These alcohol-
induced disorders are diagnosed instead of alcohol intoxication or al-
cohol withdrawal only when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to
warrant independent clinical attention.
Unspecified Alcohol-Related Disorder
291.9 (F10.99)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of an alcohol-related disorder that cause clinically significant dis-
tress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any
specific alcohol-related disorder or any of the disorders in the sub-
stance-related and addictive disorders diagnostic class.
Caffeine-Related Disorders
Caffeine Intoxication
305.90 (F15.929)

A. Prolonged daily use of caffeine.
B. Abrupt cessation of or reduction in caffeine use, followed within
24 hours by three (or more) of the following signs or symptoms:
1. Headache.
2. Marked fatigue or drowsiness.
3. Dysphoric mood, depressed mood, or irritability.
4. Difficulty concentrating.
5. Flu-like symptoms (nausea, vomiting, or muscle pain/stiff-
ness).
C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important
areas of functioning.
D. The signs or symptoms are not associated with the physiological
effects of another medical condition (e.g., migraine, viral illness)

Unspecified Caffeine-Related Disorder 239
and are not better explained by another mental disorder, includ-
ing intoxication or withdrawal from another substance.
Other Caffeine-Induced Disorders
The following caffeine-induced disorders are described in other chap-
ters of the book with disorders with which they share phenomenol-
ogy (see the substance/medication-induced mental disorders in these
chapters): caffeine-induced anxiety disorder (“Anxiety Disorders”)
and caffeine-induced sleep disorder (“Sleep-Wake Disorders”). These
caffeine-induced disorders are diagnosed instead of caffeine intoxica-
tion or caffeine withdrawal only when the symptoms are sufficiently
severe to warrant independent clinical attention.
Unspecified Caffeine-Related Disorder
292.9 (F15.99)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a caffeine-related disorder that cause clinically significant dis-
tress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any
specific caffeine-related disorder or any of the disorders in the sub-
stance-related and addictive disorders diagnostic class.
Cannabis-Related Disorders

A. A problematic pattern of cannabis use leading to clinically signif-
icant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the
following, occurring within a 12-month period:

240 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
1. Cannabis is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer
period than was intended.

are given up or reduced because of cannabis use.
8. Recurrent cannabis use in situations in which it is physi-
cally hazardous.
9. Cannabis use is continued despite knowledge of having a
persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that
is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by cannabis.
10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
a. A need for markedly increased amounts of cannabis
to achieve intoxication or desired effect.
b. Markedly diminished effect with continued use of the
same amount of cannabis.
11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:
a. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for cannabis
(refer to Criteria A and B of the criteria set for cannabis
withdrawal, pp. 242–243).
b. Cannabis (or a closely related substance) is taken to
relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.
Specify if:
In early remission: After full criteria for cannabis use disorder
were previously met, none of the criteria for cannabis use disor-
der have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months
(with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire
or urge to use cannabis,” may be met).

Cannabis Intoxication 241
In sustained remission: After full criteria for cannabis use dis-
order were previously met, none of the criteria for cannabis use
disorder have been met at any time during a period of 12 months
or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a
strong desire or urge to use cannabis,” may be present).
Specify if:
In a controlled environment: This additional specifier is used if
the individual is in an environment where access to cannabis is
restricted.
Code based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If a can-
nabis intoxication, cannabis withdrawal, or another cannabis-induced
mental disorder is also present, do not use the codes below for cannabis
use disorder. Instead, the comorbid cannabis use disorder is indicated
in the 4th character of the cannabis-induced disorder code (see the cod-
ing note for cannabis intoxication, cannabis withdrawal, or a specific
cannabis-induced mental disorder). For example, if there is comorbid
cannabis-induced anxiety disorder and cannabis use disorder, only the
cannabis-induced anxiety disorder code is given, with the 4th character
indicating whether the comorbid cannabis use disorder is mild, moder-
ate, or severe: F12.180 for mild cannabis use disorder with cannabis-
induced anxiety disorder or F12.280 for a moderate, or severe cannabis
use disorder with cannabis-induced anxiety disorder.
Specify current severity:
305.20 (F12.10) Mild: Presence of 2–3 symptoms.
304.30 (F12.20) Moderate: Presence of 4–5 symptoms.
304.30 (F12.20) Severe: Presence of 6 or more symptoms.
Cannabis Intoxication
A. Recent use of cannabis.
B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological
changes (e.g., impaired motor coordination, euphoria, anxiety,
sensation of slowed time, impaired judgment, social withdrawal)
that developed during, or shortly after, cannabis use.
C. Two (or more) of the following signs or symptoms developing
within 2 hours of cannabis use:

242 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
1. Conjunctival injection.
2. Increased appetite.
3. Dry mouth.
4. Tachycardia.
D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disor-
der, including intoxication with another substance.
Specify if:
With perceptual disturbances: Hallucinations with intact reality
testing or auditory, visual, or tactile illusions occur in the absence
of a delirium.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.89. The ICD-10-CM code
depends on whether or not there is a comorbid cannabis use disorder
and whether or not there are perceptual disturbances.
For cannabis intoxication, without perceptual disturbances:
If a mild cannabis use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code
is F12.129, and if a moderate or severe cannabis use disorder is
comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F12.229. If there is no comor-
bid cannabis use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F12.929.
For cannabis intoxication, with perceptual disturbances: If a
mild cannabis use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is
F12.122, and if a moderate or severe cannabis use disorder is
comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F12.222. If there is no comor-
bid cannabis use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F12.922.
Cannabis Withdrawal
292.0 (F12.288)
A. Cessation of cannabis use that has been heavy and prolonged
(i.e., usually daily or almost daily use over a period of at least a
few months).
B. Three (or more) of the following signs and symptoms develop
within approximately 1 week after Criterion A:
1. Irritability, anger, or aggression.
2. Nervousness or anxiety.

Cannabis Withdrawal 243
3. Sleep difficulty (e.g., insomnia, disturbing dreams).
4. Decreased appetite or weight loss.
5. Restlessness.
6. Depressed mood.
7. At least one of the following physical symptoms causing
significant discomfort: abdominal pain, shakiness/tremors,
sweating, fever, chills, or headache.
C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important
areas of functioning.
D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disor-
der, including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.0. The ICD-10-CM code for
cannabis withdrawal is F12.288. Note that the ICD-10-CM code indi-
cates the comorbid presence of a moderate or severe cannabis use
disorder, reflecting the fact that cannabis withdrawal can only occur
in the presence of a moderate or severe cannabis use disorder. It is
not permissible to code a comorbid mild cannabis use disorder with
cannabis withdrawal.
Other Cannabis-Induced Disorders
The following cannabis-induced disorders are described in other
chapters of the book with disorders with which they share phenome-
nology (see the substance/medication-induced mental disorders in
these chapters): cannabis-induced psychotic disorder (“Schizophre-
nia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders”); cannabis-induced
anxiety disorder (“Anxiety Disorders”); and cannabis-induced sleep
disorder (“Sleep-Wake Disorders”). For cannabis intoxication delir-
ium, see the criteria and discussion of delirium in the chapter “Neu-
rocognitive Disorders.” These cannabis-induced disorders are
diagnosed instead of cannabis intoxication or cannabis withdrawal
when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent
clinical attention.

244 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
Unspecified Cannabis-Related Disorder
292.9 (F12.99)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a cannabis-related disorder that cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important ar-
eas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any
specific cannabis-related disorder or any of the disorders in the sub-
stance-related and addictive disorders diagnostic class.
Hallucinogen-Related Disorders
Phencyclidine Use Disorder
A. A pattern of phencyclidine (or a pharmacologically similar sub-
stance) use leading to clinically significant impairment or dis-
tress, as manifested by at least two of the following, occurring
within a 12-month period:
1. Phencyclidine is often taken in larger amounts or over a lon-
ger period than was intended.
2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut
down or control phencyclidine use.
3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain
phencyclidine, use the phencyclidine, or recover from its ef-
fects.
4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use phencyclidine.
5. Recurrent phencyclidine use resulting in a failure to fulfill ma-
jor role obligations at work, school, or home (e.g., repeated

sions, or expulsions from school; neglect of children or
household).
6. Continued phencyclidine use despite having persistent or re-
current social or interpersonal problems caused or exacer-
bated by the effects of the phencyclidine (e.g., arguments
with a spouse about consequences of intoxication; physical
fights).
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are
given up or reduced because of phencyclidine use.
8. Recurrent phencyclidine use in situations in which it is phys-
ically hazardous (e.g., driving an automobile or operating a
machine when impaired by a phencyclidine).
9. Phencyclidine use is continued despite knowledge of having
a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem
that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by the
phencyclidine.
10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
a. A need for markedly increased amounts of the phency-
clidine to achieve intoxication or desired effect.
b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the
same amount of the phencyclidine.
Note: Withdrawal symptoms and signs are not established for
phencyclidines, and so this criterion does not apply. (Withdrawal
from phencyclidines has been reported in animals but not docu-
mented in human users.)
Specify if:
In early remission: After full criteria for phencyclidine use disor-
der were previously met, none of the criteria for phencyclidine
use disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less
than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or
a strong desire or urge to use the phencyclidine,” may be met).
In sustained remission: After full criteria for phencyclidine use dis-
order were previously met, none of the criteria for phencyclidine use
disorder have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or
longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong

Coding based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If a
phencyclidine intoxication or another phencyclidine-induced mental dis-
order is also present, do not use the codes below for phencyclidine use
disorder. Instead, the comorbid phencyclidine use disorder is indicated
in the 4th character of the phencyclidine-induced disorder code (see the
coding note for phencyclidine intoxication or a specific phencyclidine-
induced mental disorder). For example, if there is comorbid phencycli-
dine-induced psychotic disorder, only the phencyclidine-induced psy-
chotic disorder code is given, with the 4th character indicating whether
the comorbid phencyclidine use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe:
F16.159 for mild phencyclidine use disorder with phencyclidine-induced
psychotic disorder or F16.259 for a moderate or severe phencyclidine
use disorder with phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder.
Specify current severity:
305.90 (F16.10) Mild: Presence of 2–3 symptoms
304.60 (F16.20) Moderate: Presence of 4–5 symptoms
304.60 (F16.20) Severe: Presence of 6 or more symptoms
Other Hallucinogen Use Disorder
A. A problematic pattern of hallucinogen (other than phencyclidine)
use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as

absences from work or poor work performance related to
hallucinogen use; hallucinogen-related absences, suspen-
sions, or expulsions from school; neglect of children or
household).
6. Continued hallucinogen use despite having persistent or re-
current social or interpersonal problems caused or exacer-
bated by the effects of the hallucinogen (e.g., arguments with
a spouse about consequences of intoxication; physical
fights).
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are
given up or reduced because of hallucinogen use.
8. Recurrent hallucinogen use in situations in which it is physi-
cally hazardous (e.g., driving an automobile or operating a
machine when impaired by the hallucinogen).
9. Hallucinogen use is continued despite knowledge of having
a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem
that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by the hal-
lucinogen.
10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
a. A need for markedly increased amounts of the hallucino-
gen to achieve intoxication or desired effect.
b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the
same amount of the hallucinogen.
Note: Withdrawal symptoms and signs are not established for
hallucinogens, and so this criterion does not apply.
Specify the particular hallucinogen.
Specify if:
In early remission: After full criteria for other hallucinogen use dis-
order were previously met, none of the criteria for other hallucino-
gen use disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less
than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a
strong desire or urge to use the hallucinogen,” may be met).
In sustained remission: After full criteria for other hallucinogen
use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for other
hallucinogen use disorder have been met at any time during a

248 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that Criterion
A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the hallucinogen,”
may be met).
Specify if:
In a controlled environment: This additional specifier is used if
the individual is in an environment where access to hallucino-
gens is restricted.
Coding based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If a
hallucinogen intoxication or another hallucinogen-induced mental
disorder is also present, do not use the codes below for hallucinogen
use disorder. Instead, the comorbid hallucinogen use disorder is in-
dicated in the 4th character of the hallucinogen-induced disorder
code (see the coding note for hallucinogen intoxication or a specific
hallucinogen-induced mental disorder). For example, if there is co-
morbid hallucinogen-induced psychotic disorder and hallucinogen
use disorder, only the hallucinogen-induced psychotic disorder code
is given, with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid hal-
lucinogen use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe: F16.159 for mild
hallucinogen use disorder with hallucinogen-induced psychotic disor-
der or F16.259 for a moderate or severe hallucinogen use disorder
with hallucinogen-induced psychotic disorder.
Specify current severity:
305.30 (F16.10) Mild: Presence of 2–3 symptoms
304.50 (F16.20) Moderate: Presence of 4–5 symptoms
304.50 (F16.20) Severe: Presence of 6 or more symptoms

6. Muscle rigidity.
7. Seizures or coma.
8. Hyperacusis.
D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disor-
der, including intoxication with another substance.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.89. The ICD-10-CM code de-
pends on whether there is a comorbid phencyclidine use disorder. If a
mild phencyclidine use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is
F16.129, and if a moderate or severe phencyclidine use disorder is co-
morbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F16.229. If there is no comorbid phen-
cyclidine use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F16.929.
Other Hallucinogen Intoxication
A. Recent use of a hallucinogen (other than phencyclidine).
B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological
changes (e.g., marked anxiety or depression, ideas of reference,
fear of “losing one’s mind,” paranoid ideation, impaired judg-
ment) that developed during, or shortly after, hallucinogen use.
C. Perceptual changes occurring in a state of full wakefulness and
alertness (e.g., subjective intensification of perceptions, deper-

5. Blurring of vision.
6. Tremors.
7. Incoordination.
E. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disor-
der, including intoxication with another substance.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.89. The ICD-10-CM code
depends on whether there is a comorbid hallucinogen use disorder.
If a mild hallucinogen use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code
is F16.129, and if a moderate or severe hallucinogen use disorder is
comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F16.229. If there is no comorbid
hallucinogen use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F16.929.
Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder
292.89 (F16.983)
A. Following cessation of use of a hallucinogen, the reexperiencing
of one or more of the perceptual symptoms that were experi-
enced while intoxicated with the hallucinogen (e.g., geometric
hallucinations, false perceptions of movement in the peripheral
visual fields, flashes of color, intensified colors, trails of images
of moving objects, positive afterimages, halos around objects,
macropsia and micropsia).
B. The symptoms in Criterion A cause clinically significant distress
or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning.
C. The symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition
(e.g., anatomical lesions and infections of the brain, visual epi-
lepsies) and are not better explained by another mental disorder
(e.g., delirium, major neurocognitive disorder, schizophrenia) or
hypnopompic hallucinations.

Other Phencyclidine-Induced Disorders 251
Other Phencyclidine-Induced
Disorders
Other phencyclidine-induced disorders are described in other chap-
ters of the book with disorders with which they share phenomenol-
ogy (see the substance/medication-induced mental disorders in these
chapters): phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder (“Schizophre-
nia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders”); phencyclidine-
induced bipolar disorder (“Bipolar and Related Disorders”); phency-
clidine-induced depressive disorder (“Depressive Disorders”); and
phencyclidine-induced anxiety disorder (“Anxiety Disorders”). For
phencyclidine-induced intoxication delirium, see the criteria and dis-
cussion of delirium in the chapter “Neurocognitive Disorders.” These
phencyclidine-induced disorders are diagnosed instead of phencycli-
dine intoxication only when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to
warrant independent clinical attention.
Other Hallucinogen-Induced
Disorders
The following other hallucinogen-induced disorders are described in
other chapters of the book with disorders with which they share phe-
nomenology (see the substance/medication-induced mental disor-
ders in these chapters): other hallucinogen-induced psychotic
disorder (“Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders”);
other hallucinogen-induced bipolar disorder (“Bipolar and Related
Disorders”); other hallucinogen-induced depressive disorder (“De-
pressive Disorders”); and other hallucinogen-induced anxiety disor-
der (“Anxiety Disorders”). For other hallucinogen intoxication
delirium, see the criteria and discussion of delirium in the chapter
“Neurocognitive Disorders.” These hallucinogen-induced disorders
are diagnosed instead of other hallucinogen intoxication only when
the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical
attention.

Unspecified Phencyclidine-Related Disorder
292.9 (F16.99)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a phencyclidine-related disorder that cause clinically signifi-
cant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important
areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for
any specific phencyclidine-related disorder or any of the disorders in
the substance-related and addictive disorders diagnostic class.

over a longer period than was intended.

Inhalant Use Disorder 253
2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut
down or control use of the inhalant substance.
3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain
the inhalant substance, use it, or recover from its effects.
4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the inhalant sub-
stance.
5. Recurrent use of the inhalant substance resulting in a failure
to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home.
6. Continued use of the inhalant substance despite having per-
sistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused
or exacerbated by the effects of its use.
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are giv-
en up or reduced because of use of the inhalant substance.
8. Recurrent use of the inhalant substance in situations in
which it is physically hazardous.
9. Use of the inhalant substance is continued despite knowl-
edge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psy-
chological problem that is likely to have been caused or
exacerbated by the substance.
10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
a. A need for markedly increased amounts of the inhalant
substance to achieve intoxication or desired effect.
b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the
same amount of the inhalant substance.
Specify the particular inhalant: When possible, the particular sub-
stance involved should be named (e.g., “solvent use disorder”).
Specify if:
In early remission: After full criteria for inhalant use disorder
were previously met, none of the criteria for inhalant use disorder
have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months
(with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire
or urge to use the inhalant substance,” may be met).
In sustained remission: After full criteria for inhalant use disor-
der were previously met, none of the criteria for inhalant use dis-
order have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or
longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong
desire or urge to use the inhalant substance,” may be met).

254 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
Specify if:
In a controlled environment: This additional specifier is used if
the individual is in an environment where access to inhalant sub-
stances is restricted.
Coding based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If
an inhalant intoxication or another inhalant-induced mental disorder
is also present, do not use the codes below for inhalant use disorder.
Instead, the comorbid inhalant use disorder is indicated in the 4th
character of the inhalant-induced disorder code (see the coding note
for inhalant intoxication or a specific inhalant-induced mental disor-
der). For example, if there is comorbid inhalant-induced depressive
disorder and inhalant use disorder, only the inhalant-induced depres-
sive disorder code is given, with the 4th character indicating whether
the comorbid inhalant use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe:
F18.14 for mild inhalant use disorder with inhalant-induced depres-
sive disorder or F18.24 for a moderate or severe inhalant use disor-
der with inhalant-induced depressive disorder.
Specify current severity:
305.90 (F18.10) Mild: Presence of 2–3 symptoms.
304.60 (F18.20) Moderate: Presence of 4–5 symptoms.
304.60 (F18.20) Severe: Presence of 6 or more symptoms.
Inhalant Intoxication
A. Recent intended or unintended short-term, high-dose exposure
to inhalant substances, including volatile hydrocarbons such as
toluene or gasoline.
B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological
changes (e.g., belligerence, assaultiveness, apathy, impaired
judgment) that developed during, or shortly after, exposure to in-
halants.
C. Two (or more) of the following signs or symptoms developing
during, or shortly after, inhalant use or exposure:
1. Dizziness.
2. Nystagmus.
3. Incoordination.

Inhalant Intoxication 255
4. Slurred speech.
5. Unsteady gait.
6. Lethargy.
7. Depressed reflexes.
8. Psychomotor retardation.
9. Tremor.
10. Generalized muscle weakness.
11. Blurred vision or diplopia.
12. Stupor or coma.
13. Euphoria.
D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disor-
der, including intoxication with another substance.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.89. The ICD-10-CM code
depends on whether there is a comorbid inhalant use disorder. If a
mild inhalant use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is
F18.129, and if a moderate or severe inhalant use disorder is comor-
bid, the ICD-10-CM code is F18.229. If there is no comorbid inhalant
use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F18.929.
Other Inhalant-Induced Disorders
The following inhalant-induced disorders are described in other
chapters of the book with disorders with which they share phenome-
nology (see the substance/medication-induced mental disorders in
these chapters): inhalant-induced psychotic disorder (“Schizophrenia
Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders”); inhalant-induced depres-
sive disorder (“Depressive Disorders”); and inhalant-induced anxi-
ety disorder (“Anxiety Disorders”); inhalant-induced major or mild
neurocognitive disorder (“Neurocognitive Disorders”). For inhalant
intoxication delirium, see the criteria and discussion of delirium in
the chapter “Neurocognitive Disorders.” These inhalant-induced dis-
orders are diagnosed instead of inhalant intoxication only when
symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical at-
tention.

256 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
Unspecified Inhalant-Related Disorder
292.9 (F18.99)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of an inhalant-related disorder that cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important ar-
eas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any
specific inhalant-related disorder or any of the disorders in the sub-
stance-related and addictive disorders diagnostic class.
Opioid-Related Disorders
Opioid Use Disorder
A. A problematic pattern of opioid use leading to clinically significant
impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the fol-
lowing, occurring within a 12-month period:
1. Opioids are often taken in larger amounts or over a longer
period than was intended.
2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut
down or control opioid use.
3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain
the opioid, use the opioid, or recover from its effects.
4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use opioids.
5. Recurrent opioid use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role
obligations at work, school, or home.
6. Continued opioid use despite having persistent or recurrent
social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by
the effects of opioids.
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are
given up or reduced because of opioid use.
8. Recurrent opioid use in situations in which it is physically
hazardous.

Opioid Use Disorder 257
9. Continued opioid use despite knowledge of having a persis-
tent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is
likely to have been caused or exacerbated by the substance.
10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
a. A need for markedly increased amounts of opioids to
achieve intoxication or desired effect.
b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the
same amount of an opioid.
Note: This criterion is not considered to be met for those tak-
ing opioids solely under appropriate medical supervision.
11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:
a. The characteristic opioid withdrawal syndrome (refer to
Criteria A and B of the criteria set for opioid withdrawal,
pp. 259–260).
b. Opioids (or a closely related substance) are taken to re-
lieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.
Note: This criterion is not considered to be met for those in-
dividuals taking opioids solely under appropriate medical su-
pervision.
Specify if:
In early remission: After full criteria for opioid use disorder were
previously met, none of the criteria for opioid use disorder have
been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with
the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or
urge to use opioids,” may be met).
In sustained remission: After full criteria for opioid use disorder
were previously met, none of the criteria for opioid use disorder
have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or longer
(with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire
or urge to use opioids,” may be met).
Specify if:
On maintenance therapy: This additional specifier is used if the
individual is taking a prescribed agonist medication such as
methadone or buprenorphine and none of the criteria for opioid
use disorder have been met for that class of medication (except
tolerance to, or withdrawal from, the agonist). This category also

258 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
applies to those individuals being maintained on a partial ago-
nist, an agonist/antagonist, or a full antagonist such as oral nal-
trexone or depot naltrexone.
In a controlled environment: This additional specifier is used if the
individual is in an environment where access to opioids is restricted.
Coding based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If an
opioid intoxication, opioid withdrawal, or another opioid-induced mental
disorder is also present, do not use the codes below for opioid use
disorder. Instead, the comorbid opioid use disorder is indicated in the
4th character of the opioid-induced disorder code (see the coding note
for opioid intoxication, opioid withdrawal, or specific opioid-induced
mental disorder). For example, if there is comorbid opioid-induced de-
pressive disorder and opioid use disorder, only the opioid-induced
depressive disorder code is given, with the 4th character indicating
whether the comorbid opioid use disorder is mild, moderate, or se-
vere: F11.14 for mild opioid use disorder with opioid-induced depres-
sive disorder or F11.24 for a moderate or severe opioid use disorder
with opioid-induced depressive disorder.
Specify current severity:
305.50 (F11.10) Mild: Presence of 2–3 symptoms.
304.00 (F11.20) Moderate: Presence of 4–5 symptoms.
304.00 (F11.20) Severe: Presence of 6 or more symptoms.
Opioid Intoxication
A. Recent use of an opioid.
B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological
changes (e.g., initial euphoria followed by apathy, dysphoria, psy-
chomotor agitation or retardation, impaired judgment) that devel-
oped during, or shortly after, opioid use.
C. Pupillary constriction (or pupillary dilation due to anoxia from se-
vere overdose) and one (or more) of the following signs or symp-
toms developing during, or shortly after, opioid use:
1. Drowsiness or coma.
2. Slurred speech.
3. Impairment in attention or memory.

Opioid Withdrawal 259
D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disor-
der, including intoxication with another substance.
Specify if:
With perceptual disturbances: This specifier may be noted in
the rare instance in which hallucinations with intact reality testing
or auditory, visual, or tactile illusions occur in the absence of a
delirium.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.89. The ICD-10-CM code
depends on whether or not there is a comorbid opioid use disorder
and whether or not there are perceptual disturbances.
For opioid intoxication without perceptual disturbances: If a
mild opioid use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is
F11.129, and if a moderate or severe opioid use disorder is co-
morbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F11.229. If there is no comorbid
opioid use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F11.929.
For opioid intoxication with perceptual disturbances: If a
mild opioid use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is
F11.122, and if a moderate or severe opioid use disorder is co-
morbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F11.222. If there is no comorbid
opioid use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F11.922.
Opioid Withdrawal
292.0 (F11.23)
A. Presence of either of the following:
1. Cessation of (or reduction in) opioid use that has been heavy
and prolonged (i.e., several weeks or longer).
2. Administration of an opioid antagonist after a period of opioid
use.
B. Three (or more) of the following developing within minutes to
several days after Criterion A:
1. Dysphoric mood.
2. Nausea or vomiting.

260 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
3. Muscle aches.
4. Lacrimation or rhinorrhea.
5. Pupillary dilation, piloerection, or sweating.
6. Diarrhea.
7. Yawning.
8. Fever.
9. Insomnia.
C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important
areas of functioning.
D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disor-
der, including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.0. The ICD-10-CM code for
opioid withdrawal is F11.23. Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates
the comorbid presence of a moderate or severe opioid use disorder,
reflecting the fact that opioid withdrawal can only occur in the pres-
ence of a moderate or severe opioid use disorder. It is not permis-
sible to code a comorbid mild opioid use disorder with opioid
withdrawal.
Other Opioid-Induced Disorders
The following opioid-induced disorders are described in other chap-
ters of the book with disorders with which they share phenomenol-
ogy (see the substance/medication-induced mental disorders in these
chapters): opioid-induced depressive disorder (“Depressive Dis-
orders”); opioid-induced anxiety disorder (“Anxiety Disorders”); opi-
oid-induced sleep disorder (“Sleep-Wake Disorders”); and opioid-
induced sexual dysfunction (“Sexual Dysfunctions”). For opioid in-
toxication delirium and opioid withdrawal delirium, see the criteria
and discussion of delirium in the chapter “Neurocognitive Disor-
ders.” These opioid-induced disorders are diagnosed instead of opi-
oid intoxication or opioid withdrawal only when the symptoms are
sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention.

Unspecified Opioid-Related Disorder 261
Unspecified Opioid-Related Disorder
292.9 (F11.99)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of an opioid-related disorder that cause clinically significant dis-

amounts or over a longer period than was intended.
2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut
down or control sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use.
3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain
the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic; use the sedative, hyp-

tive-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-related absences, suspensions,
or expulsions from school; neglect of children or household).

262 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
6. Continued sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use despite hav-
ing persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems
caused or exacerbated by the effects of sedatives, hypnot-
ics, or anxiolytics (e.g., arguments with a spouse about con-

7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are
given up or reduced because of sedative, hypnotic, or anxio-
lytic use.
8. Recurrent sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use in situations
in which it is physically hazardous (e.g., driving an automo-
bile or operating a machine when impaired by sedative, hyp-
notic, or anxiolytic use).
9. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use is continued despite
knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or
psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or
exacerbated by the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic.
10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
a. A need for markedly increased amounts of the sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic to achieve intoxication or desired
effect.
b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the
same amount of the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic.

als taking sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics under medical
supervision.
11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:
a. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for sedatives,
hypnotics, or anxiolytics (refer to Criteria A and B of the
criteria set for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdraw-
al, pp. 265–266).

substance, such as alcohol) are taken to relieve or avoid
withdrawal symptoms.
Note: This criterion is not considered to be met for individu-
als taking sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics under medical
supervision.

Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder 263
Specify if:
In early remission: After full criteria for sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria
for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder have been met
for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with the excep-
tion that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use
the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic,” may be met).
In sustained remission: After full criteria for sedative, hypnotic,
or anxiolytic use disorder were previously met, none of the crite-
ria for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder have been
met at any time during a period of 12 months or longer (with the
exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge
to use the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic,” may be met).
Specify if:
In a controlled environment: This additional specifier is used if
the individual is in an environment where access to sedatives,
hypnotics, or anxiolytics is restricted.
Coding based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If a
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication; sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic withdrawal; or another sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-
induced mental disorder is also present, do not use the codes below
for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder. Instead, the comorbid
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder is indicated in the 4th
character of the sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced disorder
(see the coding note for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication;
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal; or a specific sedative-,
hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced mental disorder). For example, if there
is comorbid sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced depressive dis-
order and sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, only the sed-
ative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced depressive disorder code is
given, with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe:
F13.14 for mild sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder with sed-
ative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced depressive disorder or F13.24
for a moderate or severe sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder
with sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced depressive disorder.

264 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
Specify current severity:
305.40 (F13.10) Mild: Presence of 2–3 symptoms.
304.10 (F13.20) Moderate: Presence of 4–5 symptoms.
304.10 (F13.20) Severe: Presence of 6 or more symptoms.
Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication
A. Recent use of a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic.
B. Clinically significant maladaptive behavioral or psychological
changes (e.g., inappropriate sexual or aggressive behavior,
mood lability, impaired judgment) that developed during, or shortly
after, sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use.
C. One (or more) of the following signs or symptoms developing
during, or shortly after, sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use:
1. Slurred speech.
2. Incoordination.

6. Stupor or coma.
D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disor-
der, including intoxication with another substance.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.89. The ICD-10-CM code
depends on whether there is a comorbid sedative, hypnotic, or anx-
iolytic use disorder. If a mild sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use dis-
order is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F13.129, and if a moderate
or severe sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder is comorbid,
the ICD-10-CM code is F13.229. If there is no comorbid sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is
F13.929.

Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Withdrawal 265
Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Withdrawal
A. Cessation of (or reduction in) sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
use that has been prolonged.

distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important
areas of functioning.
D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disor-
der, including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance.
Specify if:
With perceptual disturbances: This specifier may be noted
when hallucinations with intact reality testing or auditory, visual,
or tactile illusions occur in the absence of a delirium.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.0. The ICD-10-CM code for
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal depends on whether or
not there is a comorbid moderate or severe sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic use disorder and whether or not there are perceptual dis-
turbances. For sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal without
perceptual disturbances, the ICD-10-CM code is F13.239. For seda-
tive, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal with perceptual disturbances,
the ICD-10-CM code is F13.232. Note that the ICD-10-CM codes in-
dicate the comorbid presence of a moderate or severe sedative, hyp-

266 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
notic, or anxiolytic use disorder, reflecting the fact that sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal can only occur in the presence of a
moderate or severe sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder. It
is not permissible to code a comorbid mild sedative, hypnotic, or anx-
iolytic use disorder with sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal.
Other Sedative-, Hypnotic-,
or Anxiolytic-Induced Disorders
The following sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced disorders
are described in other chapters of the book with disorders with which
they share phenomenology (see the substance/medication-induced
mental disorders in these chapters): sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-
induced psychotic disorder (“Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other
Psychotic Disorders”); sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced bi-
polar disorder (“Bipolar and Related Disorders”); sedative-, hyp-
notic-, or anxiolytic-induced depressive disorder (“Depressive
Disorders”); sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced anxiety dis-
order (“Anxiety Disorders”); sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-
induced sleep disorder (“Sleep-Wake Disorders”); sedative-, hyp-
notic-, or anxiolytic-induced sexual dysfunction (“Sexual Dysfunc-
tions”); and sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced major or mild
neurocognitive disorder (“Neurocognitive Disorders”). For sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication delirium and sedative, hypnotic,
or anxiolytic withdrawal delirium, see the criteria and discussion of
delirium in the chapter “Neurocognitive Disorders.” These sedative-
, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced disorders are diagnosed instead of
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication or sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic withdrawal only when the symptoms are sufficiently se-
vere to warrant independent clinical attention.

Unspecified Sedative- or Hypnotic-Related Disorder 267
Unspecified Sedative-, Hypnotic-,

268 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
6. Continued stimulant use despite having persistent or recur-
rent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated
by the effects of the stimulant.
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are
given up or reduced because of stimulant use.
8. Recurrent stimulant use in situations in which it is physically
hazardous.
9. Stimulant use is continued despite knowledge of having a
persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem
that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by the stim-
ulant.
10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
a. A need for markedly increased amounts of the stimulant
to achieve intoxication or desired effect.
b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the
same amount of the stimulant.
Note: This criterion is not considered to be met for those tak-
ing stimulant medications solely under appropriate medical
supervision, such as medications for attention-deficit/hyper-
activity disorder or narcolepsy.
11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:
a. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for the stimulant
(refer to Criteria A and B of the criteria set for stimulant
withdrawal, p. 272).
b. The stimulant (or a closely related substance) is taken to

Specify if:
In early remission: After full criteria for stimulant use disorder
were previously met, none of the criteria for stimulant use disorder
have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months
(with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire
or urge to use the stimulant,” may be met).

Stimulant Use Disorder 269
In sustained remission: After full criteria for stimulant use dis-
order were previously met, none of the criteria for stimulant use
disorder have been met at any time during a period of 12 months
or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a
strong desire or urge to use the stimulant,” may be met).
Specify if:
In a controlled environment: This additional specifier is used if
the individual is in an environment where access to stimulants is
restricted.
Coding based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If an
amphetamine intoxication, amphetamine withdrawal, or another am-
phetamine-induced mental disorder is also present, do not use the
codes below for amphetamine use disorder. Instead, the comorbid
amphetamine use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the am-
phetamine-induced disorder code (see the coding note for amphet-
amine intoxication, amphetamine withdrawal, or a specific amphet-
amine-induced mental disorder). For example, if there is comorbid
amphetamine-type or other stimulant-induced depressive disorder and
amphetamine-type or other stimulant use disorder, only the amphet-
amine-type or other stimulant-induced depressive disorder code is
given, with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid amphet-
amine-type or other stimulant use disorder is mild, moderate, or se-

der with amphetamine-type or other stimulant-induced depressive
disorder or F15.24 for a moderate or severe amphetamine-type or
other stimulant use disorder with amphetamine-type or other stimu-
lant-induced depressive disorder. Similarly, if there is comorbid co-
caine-induced depressive disorder and cocaine use disorder, only the
cocaine-induced depressive disorder code is given, with the 4th char-
acter indicating whether the comorbid cocaine use disorder is mild,
moderate, or severe: F14.14 for mild cocaine use disorder with co-
caine-induced depressive disorder or F14.24 for a moderate or severe
cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced depressive disorder.
Specify current severity:
Mild: Presence of 2–3 symptoms

Stimulant Intoxication
A. Recent use of an amphetamine-type substance, cocaine, or
other stimulant.
B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological
changes (e.g., euphoria or affective blunting; changes in socia-
bility; hypervigilance; interpersonal sensitivity; anxiety, tension,
or anger; stereotyped behaviors; impaired judgment) that devel-
oped during, or shortly after, use of a stimulant.
C. Two (or more) of the following signs or symptoms, developing
during, or shortly after, stimulant use:
1. Tachycardia or bradycardia.
2. Pupillary dilation.
3. Elevated or lowered blood pressure.
4. Perspiration or chills.
5. Nausea or vomiting.
6. Evidence of weight loss.
7. Psychomotor agitation or retardation.
8. Muscular weakness, respiratory depression, chest pain, or
cardiac arrhythmias.
9. Confusion, seizures, dyskinesias, dystonias, or coma.
D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disor-
der, including intoxication with another substance.

Stimulant Intoxication 271
Specify the specific intoxicant (i.e., amphetamine-type substance,
cocaine, or other stimulant).
Specify if:
With perceptual disturbances: This specifier may be noted
when hallucinations with intact reality testing or auditory, visual,
or tactile illusions occur in the absence of a delirium.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.89. The ICD-10-CM code
depends on whether the stimulant is an amphetamine, cocaine, or
other stimulant; whether there is a comorbid amphetamine, cocaine,
or other stimulant use disorder; and whether or not there are percep-
tual disturbances.
For amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant intoxication,
without perceptual disturbances: If a mild amphetamine or
other stimulant use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is
F15.129, and if a moderate or severe amphetamine or other
stimulant use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is
F15.229. If there is no comorbid amphetamine or other stimulant
use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F15.929. Similarly, if a
mild cocaine use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is
F14.129, and if a moderate or severe cocaine use disorder is co-
morbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F14.229. If there is no comorbid
cocaine use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F14.929.
For amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant intoxication,
with perceptual disturbances: If a mild amphetamine or other
stimulant use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is
F15.122, and if a moderate or severe amphetamine or other
stimulant use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is
F15.222. If there is no comorbid amphetamine or other stimulant
use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F15.922. Similarly, if a
mild cocaine use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is
F14.122, and if a moderate or severe cocaine use disorder is co-
morbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F14.222. If there is no comorbid
cocaine use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F14.922.

272 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
Stimulant Withdrawal
A. Cessation of (or reduction in) prolonged amphetamine-type sub-
stance, cocaine, or other stimulant use.
B. Dysphoric mood and two (or more) of the following physiological
changes, developing within a few hours to several days after Cri-
terion A:
1. Fatigue.
2. Vivid, unpleasant dreams.
3. Insomnia or hypersomnia.
4. Increased appetite.
5. Psychomotor retardation or agitation.
C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important
areas of functioning.
D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disor-
der, including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance.
Specify the specific substance that causes the withdrawal syn-
drome (i.e., amphetamine-type substance, cocaine, or other stimulant).
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.0. The ICD-10-CM code
depends on whether the stimulant is an amphetamine, cocaine, or
another stimulant. The ICD-10-CM code for amphetamine or other
stimulant withdrawal is F15.23, and the ICD-10-CM for cocaine with-
drawal is F14.23. Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates the comor-
bid presence of a moderate or severe amphetamine, cocaine, or
other stimulant use disorder, reflecting the fact that amphetamine,
cocaine, or other stimulant withdrawal can only occur in the presence
of a moderate or severe amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant
use disorder. It is not permissible to code a comorbid mild amphet-
amine, cocaine, or other stimulant use disorder with amphetamine,
cocaine, or other stimulant withdrawal.

Unspecified Stimulant-Related Disorder 273
Other Stimulant-Induced Disorders
The following stimulant-induced disorders (which include amphet-
amine-, cocaine-, and other stimulant–induced disorders) are de-
scribed in other chapters of the book with disorders with which they
share phenomenology (see the substance/medication-induced men-
tal disorders in these chapters): stimulant-induced psychotic disorder
(“Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders”); stimu-
lant-induced bipolar disorder (“Bipolar and Related Disorders”);
stimulant-induced depressive disorder (“Depressive Disorders”);
stimulant-induced anxiety disorder (“Anxiety Disorders”); stimu-
lant-induced obsessive-compulsive disorder (“Obsessive-Compul-
sive and Related Disorders”); stimulant-induced sleep disorder
(“Sleep-Wake Disorders”); and stimulant-induced sexual dysfunc-
tion (“Sexual Dysfunctions”). For stimulant intoxication delirium, see
the criteria and discussion of delirium in the chapter “Neurocognitive
Disorders.” These stimulant-induced disorders are diagnosed instead
of stimulant intoxication or stimulant withdrawal only when the
symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical at-
tention.
Unspecified Stimulant-Related Disorder
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a stimulant-related disorder that cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important ar-
eas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any
specific stimulant-related disorder or any of the disorders in the sub-
stance-related and addictive disorders diagnostic class.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.9. The ICD-10-CM code
depends on whether the stimulant is an amphetamine, cocaine, or
another stimulant. The ICD-10-CM code for an unspecified amphet-
amine- or other stimulant-related disorder is F15.99. The ICD-10-CM
code for an unspecified cocaine-related disorder is F14.99.

274 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
Tobacco-Related Disorders
Tobacco Use Disorder
A. A problematic pattern of tobacco use leading to clinically signifi-
cant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the
following, occurring within a 12-month period:
1. Tobacco is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer pe-
riod than was intended.
2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut
down or control tobacco use.
3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain
or use tobacco.
4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use tobacco.
5. Recurrent tobacco use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role
obligations at work, school, or home (e.g., interference with
work).
6. Continued tobacco use despite having persistent or recur-
rent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated
by the effects of tobacco (e.g., arguments with others about
tobacco use).
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are
given up or reduced because of tobacco use.
8. Recurrent tobacco use in situations in which it is physically
hazardous (e.g., smoking in bed).
9. Tobacco use is continued despite knowledge of having a
persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem
that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by tobacco.
10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
a. A need for markedly increased amounts of tobacco to
achieve the desired effect.
b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the
same amount of tobacco.

Tobacco Use Disorder 275
11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:
a. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for tobacco (refer
to Criteria A and B of the criteria set for tobacco withdrawal).
b. Tobacco (or a closely related substance, such as nico-
tine) is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.
Specify if:
In early remission: After full criteria for tobacco use disorder
were previously met, none of the criteria for tobacco use disorder
have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months
(with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire
or urge to use tobacco,” may be met).
In sustained remission: After full criteria for tobacco use disor-
der were previously met, none of the criteria for tobacco use dis-
order have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or
longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong
desire or urge to use tobacco,” may be met).
Specify if:
On maintenance therapy: The individual is taking a long-term
maintenance medication, such as nicotine replacement medica-
tion, and no criteria for tobacco use disorder have been met for
that class of medication (except tolerance to, or withdrawal from,
the nicotine replacement medication).
In a controlled environment: This additional specifier is used if
the individual is in an environment where access to tobacco is re-
stricted.
Coding based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If a to-
bacco withdrawal or tobacco-induced sleep disorder is also present, do
not use the codes below for tobacco use disorder. Instead, the comor-
bid tobacco use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the tobacco-
induced disorder code (see the coding note for tobacco withdrawal or
tobacco-induced sleep disorder). For example, if there is comorbid to-
bacco-induced sleep disorder and tobacco use disorder, only the
tobacco-induced sleep disorder code is given, with the 4th character in-
dicating whether the comorbid tobacco use disorder is moderate or se-
vere: F17.208 for moderate or severe tobacco use disorder with
tobacco-induced sleep disorder. It is not permissible to code a comor-
bid mild tobacco use disorder with a tobacco-induced sleep disorder.

276 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
Specify current severity:
305.1 (Z72.0) Mild: Presence of 2–3 symptoms
305.1 (F17.200) Moderate: Presence of 4–5 symptoms
305.1 (F17.200) Severe: Presence of 6 or more symptoms

2. Anxiety.
3. Difficulty concentrating.
4. Increased appetite.
5. Restlessness.
6. Depressed mood.
7. Insomnia.
C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important
areas of functioning.
D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disor-
der, including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.0. The ICD-10-CM code for
tobacco withdrawal is F17.203. Note that the ICD-10-CM code indi-
cates the comorbid presence of a moderate or severe tobacco use
disorder, reflecting the fact that tobacco withdrawal can only occur in
the presence of a moderate or severe tobacco use disorder. It is not
permissible to code a comorbid mild tobacco use disorder with tobac-
co withdrawal.

Unspecified Tobacco-Related Disorder 277
Other Tobacco-Induced
Disorders
Tobacco-induced sleep disorder is discussed in the chapter “Sleep-
Wake Disorders” (see “Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disor-
der”).
Unspecified Tobacco-Related Disorder
292.9 (F17.209)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a tobacco-related disorder that cause clinically significant dis-
tress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any
specific tobacco-related disorder or any of the disorders in the sub-
stance-related and addictive disorders diagnostic class.

A. A problematic pattern of use of an intoxicating substance not able
to be classified within the alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; hallucino-
gen (phencyclidine and others); inhalant; opioid; sedative, hyp-
notic, or anxiolytic; stimulant; or tobacco categories and leading
to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at
least two of the following, occurring within a 12-month period:
1. The substance is often taken in larger amounts or over a lon-
ger period than was intended.

278 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

5. Recurrent use of the substance resulting in a failure to fulfill
major role obligations at work, school, or home.
6. Continued use of the substance despite having persistent or
recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacer-
bated by the effects of its use.
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are
given up or reduced because of use of the substance.
8. Recurrent use of the substance in situations in which it is
physically hazardous.
9. Use of the substance is continued despite knowledge of hav-
ing a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological prob-
lem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by the
substance.

a. A need for markedly increased amounts of the sub-
stance to achieve intoxication or desired effect.
b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the
same amount of the substance.
11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:
a. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for other (or un-
known) substance (refer to Criteria A and B of the criteria
sets for other [or unknown] substance withdrawal, pp.
280–281).
b. The substance (or a closely related substance) is taken to
relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.
Specify if:
In early remission: After full criteria for other (or unknown) sub-
stance use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for
other (or unknown) substance use disorder have been met for at
least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with the exception

that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the
substance,” may be met).
In sustained remission: After full criteria for other (or unknown)
substance use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria
for other (or unknown) substance use disorder have been met at
any time during a period of 12 months or longer (with the excep-
tion that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use
the substance,” may be met).
Specify if:
In a controlled environment: This additional specifier is used if
the individual is in an environment where access to the sub-
stance is restricted.
Coding based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If
an other (or unknown) substance intoxication, other (or unknown)
substance withdrawal, or another other (or unknown) substance–
induced mental disorder is present, do not use the codes below for
other (or unknown) substance use disorder. Instead, the comorbid
other (or unknown) substance use disorder is indicated in the 4th
character of the other (or unknown) substance–induced disorder
code (see the coding note for other (or unknown) substance intoxica-
tion, other (or unknown) substance withdrawal, or specific other (or
unknown) substance–induced mental disorder). For example, if there
is comorbid other (or unknown) substance–induced depressive dis-
order and other (or unknown) substance use disorder, only the other
(or unknown) substance–induced depressive disorder code is given
with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid other (or un-
known) substance use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe: F19.14
for other (or unknown) substance use disorder with other (or unknown)
substance–induced depressive disorder or F19.24 for a moderate or
severe other (or unknown) substance use disorder with other (or un-
known) substance–induced depressive disorder.
Specify current severity:
305.90 (F19.10) Mild: Presence of 2–3 symptoms.
304.90 (F19.20) Moderate: Presence of 4–5 symptoms.
304.90 (F19.20) Severe: Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

280 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
Other (or Unknown) Substance Intoxication
A. The development of a reversible substance-specific syndrome
attributable to recent ingestion of (or exposure to) a substance
that is not listed elsewhere or is unknown.
B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological
changes that are attributable to the effect of the substance on the
central nervous system (e.g., impaired motor coordination, psycho-
motor agitation or retardation, euphoria, anxiety, belligerence, mood
lability, cognitive impairment, impaired judgment, social withdrawal)
and develop during, or shortly after, use of the substance.
C. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disor-
der, including intoxication with another substance.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.89. The ICD-10-CM code
depends on whether there is a comorbid other (or unknown) sub-
stance use disorder involving the same substance. If a mild other (or
unknown) substance use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code
is F19.129, and if a moderate or severe other (or unknown) sub-
stance use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F19.229. If
there is no comorbid other (or unknown) substance use disorder in-
volving the same substance, then the ICD-10-CM code is F19.929.

and are not better explained by another mental disorder, includ-
ing withdrawal from another substance.

Other (or Unknown) Substance Withdrawal 281
E. The substance involved cannot be classified under any of the
other substance categories (alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; opioids;
sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics; stimulants; or tobacco) or is
unknown.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.0. The ICD-10-CM code for
other (or unknown) substance withdrawal is F19.239. Note that the
ICD-10-CM code indicates the comorbid presence of a moderate or
severe other (or unknown) substance use disorder. It is not permis-
sible to code a comorbid mild other (or unknown) substance use dis-
order with other (or unknown) substance withdrawal.
Other (or Unknown)
Substance–Induced Disorders
Because the category of other or unknown substances is inherently ill-
defined, the extent and range of induced disorders are uncertain.
Nevertheless, other (or unknown) substance–induced disorders are
possible and are described in other chapters of the book with disor-
ders with which they share phenomenology (see the substance/med-
ication-induced mental disorders in these chapters): other (or
unknown) substance–induced psychotic disorder (“Schizophrenia
Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders”); other (or unknown) sub-
stance–induced bipolar disorder (“Bipolar and Related Disorders”);
other (or unknown) substance–induced depressive disorder (“De-
pressive Disorders”); other (or unknown) substance–induced anxiety
disorders (“Anxiety Disorders”); other (or unknown) substance–
induced obsessive-compulsive disorder (“Obsessive-Compulsive
and Related Disorders”); other (or unknown) substance–induced
sleep disorder (“Sleep-Wake Disorders”); other (or unknown) sub-
stance–induced sexual dysfunction (“Sexual Dysfunctions”); and other
(or unknown) substance/medication–induced major or mild neu-
rocognitive disorder (“Neurocognitive Disorders”). For other (or
unknown) substance–induced intoxication delirium and other (or un-
known) substance–induced withdrawal delirium, see the criteria and
discussion of delirium in the chapter “Neurocognitive Disorders.”
These other (or unknown) substance–induced disorders are diag-

292.9 (F19.99)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of an other (or unknown) substance–related disorder that cause
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the
full criteria for any specific other (or unknown) substance–related dis-
order or any of the disorders in the substance-related disorders diag-

Neurocognitive Domains
The criteria for the various neurocognitive disorders are all based on
defined cognitive domains. Table 1 provides for each of the key do-
mains a working definition, examples of symptoms or observations
regarding impairments in everyday activities, and examples of as-
sessments. The domains thus defined, along with guidelines for clin-
ical thresholds, form the basis on which the neurocognitive disorders,
their levels, and their subtypes may be diagnosed. Additional infor-
mation is provided in DSM-5.

292 Neurocognitive Disorders
Delirium
A. A disturbance in attention (i.e., reduced ability to direct, focus,
sustain, and shift attention) and awareness (reduced orientation
to the environment).
B. The disturbance develops over a short period of time (usually
hours to a few days), represents a change from baseline atten-
tion and awareness, and tends to fluctuate in severity during the
course of a day.
C. An additional disturbance in cognition (e.g., memory deficit, dis-
orientation, language, visuospatial ability, or perception).
D. The disturbances in Criteria A and C are not better explained by
another preexisting, established, or evolving neurocognitive dis-
order and do not occur in the context of a severely reduced level
of arousal, such as coma.
E. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or labo-
ratory findings that the disturbance is a direct physiological conse-
quence of another medical condition, substance intoxication or
withdrawal (i.e., due to a drug of abuse or to a medication), or ex-
posure to a toxin, or is due to multiple etiologies.
Specify whether:
Substance intoxication delirium: This diagnosis should be
made instead of substance intoxication when the symptoms in
Criteria A and C predominate in the clinical picture and when
they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the
[specific substance] intoxication delirium are indicated in the
table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on
whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder
present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance
use disorder is comorbid with the substance intoxication de-
lirium, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician
should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the
substance intoxication delirium (e.g., “mild cocaine use dis-
order with cocaine-induced intoxication delirium”). If a mod-
erate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the
substance intoxication delirium, the 4th position character is

Delirium 293
“2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance]
use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depend-
ing on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder.
If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a
one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position
character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the sub-
stance intoxication delirium.

known) substance/medication.
Medication-induced delirium: This diagnosis applies when the
symptoms in Criteria A and C arise as a side effect of a medica-
tion taken as prescribed.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code for [specific medication]-
induced delirium is 292.81. The ICD-10-CM code depends
on the type of medication. If the medication is an opioid taken
as prescribed, the code is F11.921. If the medication is a
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic taken as prescribed, the
code is F13.921. If the medication is an amphetamine-type
or other stimulant taken as prescribed, the code is F15.921.
For medications that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g.,
dexamethasone) and in cases in which a substance is
judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of
substance is unknown, the code is F19.921.
293.0 (F05) Delirium due to another medical condition: There
is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory
findings that the disturbance is attributable to the physiological
consequences of another medical condition.
Coding note: Include the name of the other medical condi-
tion in the name of the delirium (e.g., 293.0 [F05] delirium
due to hepatic encephalopathy). The other medical condition
should also be coded and listed separately immediately be-
fore the delirium due to another medical condition (e.g.,
572.2 [K72.90] hepatic encephalopathy; 293.0 [F05] delirium
due to hepatic encephalopathy).
293.0 (F05) Delirium due to multiple etiologies: There is evi-
dence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory find-
ings that the delirium has more than one etiology (e.g., more than
one etiological medical condition; another medical condition plus
substance intoxication or medication side effect).
Coding note: Use multiple separate codes reflecting specific
delirium etiologies (e.g., 572.2 [K72.90] hepatic encephalop-
athy, 293.0 [F05] delirium due to hepatic failure; 291.0
[F10.231] alcohol withdrawal delirium). Note that the etiolog-
ical medical condition both appears as a separate code that

Delirium 295
precedes the delirium code and is substituted into the delir-
ium due to another medical condition rubric.
Specify if:
Acute: Lasting a few hours or days.
Persistent: Lasting weeks or months.
Specify if:
Hyperactive: The individual has a hyperactive level of psycho-
motor activity that may be accompanied by mood lability, agita-
tion, and/or refusal to cooperate with medical care.
Hypoactive: The individual has a hypoactive level of psychomo-
tor activity that may be accompanied by sluggishness and leth-
argy that approaches stupor.
Mixed level of activity: The individual has a normal level of
psychomotor activity even though attention and awareness are
disturbed. Also includes individuals whose activity level rapidly
fluctuates.
Recording Procedures
Substance intoxication delirium
ICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication intoxication de-
lirium begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexametha-
sone) that is presumed to be causing the delirium. The diagnostic
code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is
based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the
classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for “other substance” should
be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiolog-
ical factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category
“unknown substance” should be used.
The name of the disorder is followed by the course (i.e., acute,
persistent), followed by the specifier indicating level of psychomotor
activity (i.e., hyperactive, hypoactive, mixed level of activity). Unlike
the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the sub-
stance/medication intoxication delirium and substance use disorder
into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given
for the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of acute hy-
peractive intoxication delirium occurring in a man with a severe co-

296 Neurocognitive Disorders
caine use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.81 cocaine intoxication delir-
ium, acute, hyperactive. An additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe
cocaine use disorder is also given. If the intoxication delirium occurs
without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time
heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disor-
der is noted (e.g., 292.81 phencyclidine intoxication delirium, acute,
hypoactive).
ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication intoxication de-
lirium begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexametha-
sone) that is presumed to be causing the delirium. The diagnostic
code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is
based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid sub-
stance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the
classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for “other substance” should
be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiolog-
ical factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the cate-
gory “unknown substance” should be used.
When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance
use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word “with,” fol-
lowed by the name of the substance intoxication delirium, followed
by the course (i.e., acute, persistent), followed by the specifier indi-
cating level of psychomotor activity (i.e., hyperactive, hypoactive,
mixed level of activity). For example, in the case of acute hyperactive
intoxication delirium occurring in a man with a severe cocaine use
disorder, the diagnosis is F14.221 severe cocaine use disorder with
cocaine intoxication delirium, acute, hyperactive. A separate diagno-
sis of the comorbid severe cocaine use disorder is not given. If the
intoxication delirium occurs without a comorbid substance use dis-
order (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompa-
nying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F16.921 phencyclidine in-
toxication delirium, acute, hypoactive).
Substance withdrawal delirium
ICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication withdrawal de-
lirium begins with the specific substance (e.g., alcohol) that is pre-
sumed to be causing the withdrawal delirium. The diagnostic code is

Delirium 297
selected from substance-specific codes included in the coding note
included in the criteria set. The name of the disorder is followed by
the course (i.e., acute, persistent), followed by the specifier indicating
level of psychomotor activity (i.e., hyperactive, hypoactive, mixed
level of activity). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM,
which combine the substance/medication withdrawal delirium and
substance use disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate
diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For example,
in the case of acute hyperactive withdrawal delirium occurring in a
man with a severe alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis is 291.0 alcohol
withdrawal delirium, acute, hyperactive. An additional diagnosis of
303.90 severe alcohol use disorder is also given.
ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication withdrawal de-
lirium begins with the specific substance (e.g., alcohol) that is pre-
sumed to be causing the withdrawal delirium. The diagnostic code is
selected from substance-specific codes included in the coding note
included in the criteria set. When recording the name of the disorder,
the comorbid moderate or severe substance use disorder (if any) is
listed first, followed by the word “with,” followed by the substance
withdrawal delirium, followed by the course (i.e., acute, persistent),
followed by the specifier indicating level of psychomotor activity
(i.e., hyperactive, hypoactive, mixed level of activity). For example,
in the case of acute hyperactive withdrawal delirium occurring in a
man with a severe alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis is F10.231 se-
vere alcohol use disorder with alcohol withdrawal delirium, acute,
hyperactive. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe alcohol use
disorder is not given.
Medication-induced delirium. The name of the medication-in-
duced delirium begins with the specific substance (e.g., dexametha-
sone) that is presumed to be causing the delirium. The name of the
disorder is followed by the course (i.e., acute, persistent), followed
by the specifier indicating level of psychomotor activity (i.e., hyper-
active, hypoactive, mixed level of activity). For example, in the case
of acute hyperactive medication-induced delirium occurring in a
man using dexamethasone as prescribed, the diagnosis is 292.81
(F19.921) dexamethasone-induced delirium, acute, hyperactive.

298 Neurocognitive Disorders
Other Specified Delirium
780.09 (R41.0)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of delirium that cause clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning pre-
dominate but do not meet the full criteria for delirium or any of the dis-
orders in the neurocognitive disorders diagnostic class. The other
specified delirium category is used in situations in which the clinician
chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation
does not meet the criteria for delirium or any specific neurocognitive
disorder. This is done by recording “other specified delirium” followed
by the specific reason (e.g., “attenuated delirium syndrome”).
An example of a presentation that can be specified using the
“other specified” designation is the following:
Attenuated delirium syndrome: This syndrome applies in cases
of delirium in which the severity of cognitive impairment falls short
of that required for the diagnosis, or in which some, but not all, di-
agnostic criteria for delirium are met.
Unspecified Delirium
780.09 (R41.0)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of delirium that cause clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predom-
inate but do not meet the full criteria for delirium or any of the disorders
in the neurocognitive disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified delir-
ium category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to
specify the reason that the criteria are not met for delirium, and in-
cludes presentations for which there is insufficient information to make
a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder
Due to Alzheimer’s Disease
A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
B. There is insidious onset and gradual progression of impairment
in one or more cognitive domains (for major neurocognitive dis-
order, at least two domains must be impaired).
C. Criteria are met for either probable or possible Alzheimer’s dis-
ease as follows:
For major neurocognitive disorder:
Probable Alzheimer’s disease is diagnosed if either of the fol-
lowing is present; otherwise, possible Alzheimer’s disease
should be diagnosed.
1. Evidence of a causative Alzheimer’s disease genetic muta-
tion from family history or genetic testing.
2. All three of the following are present:
a. Clear evidence of decline in memory and learning and at
least one other cognitive domain (based on detailed his-
tory or serial neuropsychological testing).
b. Steadily progressive, gradual decline in cognition, with-
out extended plateaus.
c. No evidence of mixed etiology (i.e., absence of other
neurodegenerative or cerebrovascular disease, or an-
other neurological, mental, or systemic disease or con-
dition likely contributing to cognitive decline).
For mild neurocognitive disorder:
Probable Alzheimer’s disease is diagnosed if there is evidence
of a causative Alzheimer’s disease genetic mutation from either
genetic testing or family history.
Possible Alzheimer’s disease is diagnosed if there is no evi-
dence of a causative Alzheimer’s disease genetic mutation from
either genetic testing or family history, and all three of the follow-
ing are present:
1. Clear evidence of decline in memory and learning.
2. Steadily progressive, gradual decline in cognition, without
extended plateaus.

306 Neurocognitive Disorders
3. No evidence of mixed etiology (i.e., absence of other neuro-
degenerative or cerebrovascular disease, or another neuro-
logical or systemic disease or condition likely contributing to
cognitive decline).
D. The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular dis-
ease, another neurodegenerative disease, the effects of a sub-
stance, or another mental, neurological, or systemic disorder.

without behavioral disturbance: For ICD-9-CM, first code 907.0 late
effect of intracranial injury without skull fracture, followed by 294.10
major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury, without
behavioral disturbance. For ICD-10-CM, first code S06.2X9S diffuse
traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness of unspecified dura-
tion, sequela; followed by F02.80 major neurocognitive disorder due

the course of a delirium and persist beyond the usual duration of
intoxication and acute withdrawal.
C. The involved substance or medication and duration and extent of
use are capable of producing the neurocognitive impairment.
D. The temporal course of the neurocognitive deficits is consistent with
the timing of substance or medication use and abstinence (e.g., the
deficits remain stable or improve after a period of abstinence).

312 Neurocognitive Disorders
E. The neurocognitive disorder is not attributable to another medical
condition or is not better explained by another mental disorder.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific
substance/medication]-induced neurocognitive disorders are indicat-
ed in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on
whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present
for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is
comorbid with the substance-induced neurocognitive disorder, the
4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild
[substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced neurocogni-
tive disorder (e.g., “mild inhalant use disorder with inhalant-induced
major neurocognitive disorder”). If a moderate or severe substance
use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced neurocognitive
disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should re-
cord “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use
disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use
disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder, then the 4th
position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the sub-
stance-induced neurocognitive disorder. For some classes of sub-
stances (i.e., alcohol; sedatives, hypnotics, anxiolytics), it is not
permissible to code a comorbid mild substance use disorder with a
substance-induced neurocognitive disorder; only a comorbid moder-
ate or severe substance use disorder, or no substance use disorder,
can be diagnosed. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but
should still be indicated in writing.

314 Neurocognitive Disorders
Recording Procedures
ICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced neu-
rocognitive disorder begins with the specific substance/medication
(e.g., alcohol) that is presumed to be causing the neurocognitive
symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in
the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that
do not fit into any of the classes, the code for “other substance”
should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an
etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the
category “unknown substance” should be used.
The name of the disorder (i.e., [specific substance]-induced major
neurocognitive disorder or [specific substance]-induced mild neuro-
cognitive disorder) is followed by the type in the case of alcohol (i.e.,
nonamnestic-confabulatory type, amnestic-confabulatory type), fol-
lowed by specification of duration (i.e., persistent). Unlike the re-
cording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the substance/
medication-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a sin-
gle code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the
substance use disorder. For example, in the case of persistent amnes-
tic-confabulatory symptoms in a man with a severe alcohol use dis-
order, the diagnosis is 291.1 alcohol-induced major neurocognitive
disorder, amnestic-confabulatory type, persistent. An additional di-
agnosis of 303.90 severe alcohol use disorder is also given. If the sub-
stance/medication-induced neurocognitive disorder occurs without
a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a sporadic heavy use of
inhalants), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g.,
292.82 inhalant-induced mild neurocognitive disorder).
ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced neu-
rocognitive disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., alcohol)
that is presumed to be causing the neurocognitive symptoms. The di-
agnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set,
which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comor-
bid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of
the classes, the code for “other substance” should be used; and in
cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the
specific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown sub-
stance” should be used.

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to HIV Infection 315
When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance
use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word “with,” fol-
lowed by the name of the disorder (i.e., [specific substance]-induced
major neurocognitive disorder or [specific substance]-induced mild
neurocognitive disorder), followed by the type in the case of alcohol
(i.e., nonamnestic-confabulatory type, amnestic-confabulatory type),
followed by specification of duration (i.e., persistent). For example,
in the case of persistent amnestic-confabulatory symptoms in a man
with a severe alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis is F10.26 severe al-
cohol use disorder with alcohol-induced major neurocognitive disor-
der, amnestic-confabulatory type, persistent. A separate diagnosis of
the comorbid severe alcohol use disorder is not given. If the substance-
induced neurocognitive disorder occurs without a comorbid sub-
stance use disorder (e.g., after a sporadic heavy use of inhalants), no
accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F18.988 inhal-
ant-induced mild neurocognitive disorder).

[G31.83] Lewy body disease; 294.11 [F02.81] major neurocognitive
disorder due to multiple etiologies, with behavioral disturbance).
When a cerebrovascular etiology is contributing to the neurocogni-
tive disorder, the diagnosis of vascular neurocognitive disorder should
be listed in addition to major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple
etiologies. For example, for a presentation of major neurocognitive dis-

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a neurocognitive disorder that cause clinically significant dis-
tress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of
the disorders in the neurocognitive disorders diagnostic class. The
unspecified neurocognitive disorder category is used in situations in
which the precise etiology cannot be determined with sufficient cer-
tainty to make an etiological attribution.
Coding note: For unspecified major or mild neurocognitive disorder,
code 799.59 (R41.9). (Note: Do not use additional codes for any pre-
sumed etiological medical conditions. Behavioral disturbance cannot
be coded but may be indicated in writing.)

302.89 (F65.89)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a paraphilic disorder that cause clinically significant distress
or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the paraphilic disorders diagnostic class. The other
specified paraphilic disorder category is used in situations in which

order. This is done by recording “other specified paraphilic disorder”
followed by the specific reason (e.g., “zoophilia”).
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other
specified” designation include, but are not limited to, recurrent and in-
tense sexual arousal involving telephone scatologia (obscene phone
calls), necrophilia (corpses), zoophilia (animals), coprophilia (feces),
klismaphilia (enemas), or urophilia (urine) that has been present for at

fied paraphilic disorder category is used in situations in which the cli-
nician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met
for a specific paraphilic disorder, and includes presentations in which
there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Due to Another Medical Condition
294.8 (F06.8)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a mental disorder due to another medical condition that cause
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the
full criteria for any specific mental disorder attributable to another med-
ical condition. The other specified mental disorder due to another
medical condition category is used in situations in which the clinician
chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation
does not meet the criteria for any specific mental disorder attributable
to another medical condition. This is done by recording the name of the
disorder, with the specific etiological medical condition inserted in
place of “another medical condition,” followed by the specific symp-
tomatic manifestation that does not meet the criteria for any specific
mental disorder due to another medical condition. Furthermore, the di-
agnostic code for the specific medical condition must be listed imme-
diately before the code for the other specified mental disorder due
to another medical condition. For example, dissociative symptoms
due to complex partial seizures would be coded and recorded as
345.40 (G40.209) complex partial seizures, 294.8 (F06.8) other spec-
ified mental disorder due to complex partial seizures, dissociative
symptoms.
An example of a presentation that can be specified using the
“other specified” designation is the following:
Dissociative symptoms: This includes symptoms occurring, for
example, in the context of complex partial seizures.

clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the
full criteria for any specific mental disorder due to another medical con-
dition. The unspecified mental disorder due to another medical con-
dition category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not

ical condition inserted in place of “another medical condition.” Fur-
thermore, the diagnostic code for the specific medical condition must
be listed immediately before the code for the unspecified mental dis-
order due to another medical condition. For example, dissociative
symptoms due to complex partial seizures would be coded and re-

Medication-Induced Movement
Disorders and Other Adverse
Effects of Medication
Medication-induced movement disorders are included in
Section II because of their frequent importance in 1) the management
by medication of mental disorders or other medical conditions and
2) the differential diagnosis of mental disorders (e.g., anxiety disor-
der versus neuroleptic-induced akathisia; malignant catatonia versus
neuroleptic malignant syndrome). Although these movement disor-
ders are labeled “medication induced,” it is often difficult to estab-
lish the causal relationship between medication exposure and the
development of the movement disorder, especially because some of
these movement disorders also occur in the absence of medication
exposure. The conditions and problems listed in this chapter are not
mental disorders.
The term neuroleptic is becoming outdated because it highlights the
propensity of antipsychotic medications to cause abnormal movements,
and it is being replaced with the term antipsychotic in many contexts.
Nevertheless, the term neuroleptic remains appropriate in this context.
Although newer antipsychotic medications may be less likely to cause
some medication-induced movement disorders, those disorders still oc-
cur. Neuroleptic medications include so-called conventional, “typical,”
or first-generation antipsychotic agents (e.g., chlorpromazine, haloperi-
dol, fluphenazine); “atypical” or second-generation antipsychotic
agents (e.g., clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine); certain do-
pamine receptor–blocking drugs used in the treatment of symptoms
such as nausea and gastroparesis (e.g., prochlorperazine, promethazine,
trimethobenzamide, thiethylperazine, metoclopramide); and amoxa-
pine, which is marketed as an antidepressant.

Neuroleptic-Induced Parkinsonism
Other Medication-Induced Parkinsonism
332.1 (G21.11) Neuroleptic-Induced Parkinsonism
332.1 (G21.19) Other Medication-Induced Parkinsonism
Parkinsonian tremor, muscular rigidity, akinesia (i.e., loss of move-
ment or difficulty initiating movement), or bradykinesia (i.e., slow-
ing movement) developing within a few weeks of starting or raising
the dosage of a medication (e.g., a neuroleptic) or after reducing the
dosage of a medication used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome
333.92 (G21.0) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome
Although neuroleptic malignant syndrome is easily recognized in its
classic full-blown form, it is often heterogeneous in onset, presentation,
progression, and outcome. The clinical features described below are
those considered most important in making the diagnosis of neuroleptic
malignant syndrome based on consensus recommendations.
Diagnostic Features
Patients have generally been exposed to a dopamine antagonist with-
in 72 hours prior to symptom development. Hyperthermia (100.4F
or 38.0C on at least two occasions, measured orally), associated
with profuse diaphoresis, is a distinguishing feature of neuroleptic
malignant syndrome, setting it apart from other neurological side ef-
fects of antipsychotic medications. Extreme elevations in tempera-
ture, reflecting a breakdown in central thermoregulation, are more
likely to support the diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
Generalized rigidity, described as “lead pipe” in its most severe form
and usually unresponsive to antiparkinsonian agents, is a cardinal
feature of the disorder and may be associated with other neurological
symptoms (e.g., tremor, sialorrhea, akinesia, dystonia, trismus, my-
oclonus, dysarthria, dysphagia, rhabdomyolysis). Creatine kinase el-
evation of at least four times the upper limit of normal is commonly
seen. Changes in mental status, characterized by delirium or altered
consciousness ranging from stupor to coma, are often an early sign.
Affected individuals may appear alert but dazed and unresponsive,

Medication-Induced Movement Disorders 347
consistent with catatonic stupor. Autonomic activation and instability—
manifested by tachycardia (rate  25% above baseline), diaphoresis,
blood pressure elevation (systolic or diastolic 25% above baseline)
or fluctuation (20 mmHg diastolic change or 25 mmHg systolic
change within 24 hours), urinary incontinence, and pallor—may be
seen at any time but provide an early clue to the diagnosis. Tachy-
pnea (rate 50% above baseline) is common, and respiratory dis-
tress—resulting from metabolic acidosis, hypermetabolism, chest wall
restriction, aspiration pneumonia, or pulmonary emboli—can occur
and lead to sudden respiratory arrest.
A workup, including laboratory investigation, to exclude other in-
fectious, toxic, metabolic, and neuropsychiatric etiologies or complica-
tions is essential (see the section “Differential Diagnosis” below).
Although several laboratory abnormalities are associated with neuro-
leptic malignant syndrome, no single abnormality is specific to the di-
agnosis. Individuals with neuroleptic malignant syndrome may have
leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, hypoxia, decreased serum iron con-
centrations, and elevations in serum muscle enzymes and catechol-
amines. Findings from cerebrospinal fluid analysis and neuroimaging
studies are generally normal, whereas electroencephalography shows
generalized slowing. Autopsy findings in fatal cases have been non-
specific and variable, depending on complications.
Development and Course
Evidence from database studies suggests incidence rates for neuro-
leptic malignant syndrome of 0.01%–0.02% among individuals treated
with antipsychotics. The temporal progression of signs and symp-
toms provides important clues to the diagnosis and prognosis of
neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Alteration in mental status and
other neurological signs typically precede systemic signs. The onset
of symptoms varies from hours to days after drug initiation. Some
cases develop within 24 hours after drug initiation, most within the
first week, and virtually all cases within 30 days. Once the syndrome
is diagnosed and oral antipsychotic drugs are discontinued, neuro-
leptic malignant syndrome is self-limited in most cases. The mean
recovery time after drug discontinuation is 7–10 days, with most in-
dividuals recovering within 1 week and nearly all within 30 days.
The duration may be prolonged when long-acting antipsychotics are
implicated. There have been reports of individuals in whom residual

348 Medication-Induced Movement Disorders
neurological signs persisted for weeks after the acute hypermetabolic
symptoms resolved. Total resolution of symptoms can be obtained in
most cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome; however, fatality
rates of 10%–20% have been reported when the disorder is not recog-
nized. Although many individuals do not experience a recurrence of
neuroleptic malignant syndrome when rechallenged with antipsy-
chotic medication, some do, especially when antipsychotics are rein-
stituted soon after an episode.
Risk and Prognostic Factors
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a potential risk in any individual
after antipsychotic drug administration. It is not specific to any neu-
ropsychiatric diagnosis and may occur in individuals without a di-
agnosable mental disorder who receive dopamine antagonists.
Clinical, systemic, and metabolic factors associated with a height-
ened risk of neuroleptic malignant syndrome include agitation,
exhaustion, dehydration, and iron deficiency. A prior episode asso-
ciated with antipsychotics has been described in 15%–20% of index
cases, suggesting underlying vulnerability in some patients; how-
ever, genetic findings based on neurotransmitter receptor polymor-
phisms have not been replicated consistently.
Nearly all dopamine antagonists have been associated with neuro-
leptic malignant syndrome, although high-potency antipsychotics pose
a greater risk compared with low-potency agents and newer atypical an-
tipsychotics. Partial or milder forms may be associated with newer anti-
psychotics, but neuroleptic malignant syndrome varies in severity even
with older drugs. Dopamine antagonists used in medical settings (e.g.,
metoclopramide, prochlorperazine) have also been implicated. Paren-
teral administration routes, rapid titration rates, and higher total drug
dosages have been associated with increased risk; however, neuroleptic
malignant syndrome usually occurs within the therapeutic dosage
range of antipsychotics.
Differential Diagnosis
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome must be distinguished from other
serious neurological or medical conditions, including central ner-
vous system infections, inflammatory or autoimmune conditions,
status epilepticus, subcortical structural lesions, and systemic condi-
tions (e.g., pheochromocytoma, thyrotoxicosis, tetanus, heat stroke).

Medication-Induced Movement Disorders 349
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome also must be distinguished from
similar syndromes resulting from the use of other substances or medi-
cations, such as serotonin syndrome; parkinsonian hyperthermia syn-
drome following abrupt discontinuation of dopamine agonists; alcohol
or sedative withdrawal; malignant hyperthermia occurring during
anesthesia; hyperthermia associated with abuse of stimulants and hallu-
cinogens; and atropine poisoning from anticholinergics.
In rare instances, individuals with schizophrenia or a mood disor-
der may present with malignant catatonia, which may be indistin-
guishable from neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Some investigators
consider neuroleptic malignant syndrome to be a drug-induced form of
malignant catatonia.
Medication-Induced Acute Dystonia
333.72 (G24.02) Medication-Induced Acute Dystonia
Abnormal and prolonged contraction of the muscles of the eyes (oc-
ulogyric crisis), head, neck (torticollis or retrocollis), limbs, or trunk
developing within a few days of starting or raising the dosage of a
medication (such as a neuroleptic) or after reducing the dosage of a
medication used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms.
Medication-Induced Acute Akathisia
333.99 (G25.71) Medication-Induced Acute Akathisia
Subjective complaints of restlessness, often accompanied by ob-
served excessive movements (e.g., fidgety movements of the legs,
rocking from foot to foot, pacing, inability to sit or stand still), devel-
oping within a few weeks of starting or raising the dosage of a med-
ication (such as a neuroleptic) or after reducing the dosage of a
medication used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms.
Tardive Dyskinesia
333.85 (G24.01) Tardive Dyskinesia
Involuntary athetoid or choreiform movements (lasting at least a few
weeks) generally of the tongue, lower face and jaw, and extremities
(but sometimes involving the pharyngeal, diaphragmatic, or trunk

350 Medication-Induced Movement Disorders
muscles) developing in association with the use of a neuroleptic med-
ication for at least a few months.
Symptoms may develop after a shorter period of medication use in
older persons. In some patients, movements of this type may appear
after discontinuation, or after change or reduction in dosage, of neuro-
leptic medications, in which case the condition is called neuroleptic with-
drawal-emergent dyskinesia. Because withdrawal-emergent dyskinesia is
usually time-limited, lasting less than 4–8 weeks, dyskinesia that per-
sists beyond this window is considered to be tardive dyskinesia.
Tardive Dystonia
Tardive Akathisia
333.72 (G24.09) Tardive Dystonia
333.99 (G25.71) Tardive Akathisia
Tardive syndrome involving other types of movement problems,
such as dystonia or akathisia, which are distinguished by their late
emergence in the course of treatment and their potential persistence
for months to years, even in the face of neuroleptic discontinuation
or dosage reduction.
Medication-Induced Postural Tremor
333.1 (G25.1) Medication-Induced Postural Tremor
Fine tremor (usually in the range of 8–12 Hz) occurring during at-
tempts to maintain a posture and developing in association with the
use of medication (e.g., lithium, antidepressants, valproate). This
tremor is very similar to the tremor seen with anxiety, caffeine, and
other stimulants.

Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is a set of symptoms that can
occur after an abrupt cessation (or marked reduction in dose) of an anti-
depressant medication that was taken continuously for at least 1 month.
Symptoms generally begin within 2–4 days and typically include specif-
ic sensory, somatic, and cognitive-emotional manifestations. Frequently
reported sensory and somatic symptoms include flashes of lights,
“electric shock” sensations, nausea, and hyperresponsivity to noises
or lights. Nonspecific anxiety and feelings of dread may also be report-
ed. Symptoms are alleviated by restarting the same medication or
starting a different medication that has a similar mechanism of action—
for example, discontinuation symptoms after withdrawal from a sero-
tonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor may be alleviated by starting a
tricyclic antidepressant. To qualify as antidepressant discontinuation
syndrome, the symptoms should not have been present before the anti-
depressant dosage was reduced and are not better explained by another
mental disorder (e.g., manic or hypomanic episode, substance intoxica-
tion, substance withdrawal, somatic symptom disorder).
Diagnostic Features
Discontinuation symptoms may occur following treatment with tri-
cyclic antidepressants (e.g., imipramine, amitriptyline, desipra-
mine), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine,
sertraline), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., phenelzine,
selegiline, pargyline). The incidence of this syndrome depends on
the dosage and half-life of the medication being taken, as well as the
rate at which the medication is tapered. Short-acting medications
that are stopped abruptly rather than tapered gradually may pose
the greatest risk. The short-acting selective serotonin reuptake in-
hibitor (SSRI) paroxetine is the agent most commonly associated with
discontinuation symptoms, but such symptoms occur for all types of
antidepressants.
Unlike withdrawal syndromes associated with opioids, alcohol,
and other substances of abuse, antidepressant discontinuation syn-

352 Medication-Induced Movement Disorders
drome has no pathognomonic symptoms. Instead, the symptoms tend
to be vague and variable and typically begin 2–4 days after the last dose
of the antidepressant. For SSRIs (e.g., paroxetine), symptoms such as
dizziness, ringing in the ears, “electric shocks in the head,” an inability to
sleep, and acute anxiety are described. The antidepressant use prior to
discontinuation must not have incurred hypomania or euphoria (i.e.,
there should be confidence that the discontinuation syndrome is not the
result of fluctuations in mood stability associated with the previous
treatment). The antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is based
solely on pharmacological factors and is not related to the reinforcing ef-
fects of an antidepressant. Also, in the case of stimulant augmentation of
an antidepressant, abrupt cessation may result in stimulant withdrawal
symptoms (see “Stimulant Withdrawal” in the chapter “Substance-
Related and Addictive Disorders”) rather than the antidepressant dis-
continuation syndrome described here.
Prevalence
The prevalence of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is un-
known but is thought to vary according to the dosage prior to dis-
continuation, the half-life and receptor-binding affinity of the
medication, and possibly the individual’s genetically influenced rate
of metabolism for this medication.
Course and Development
Because longitudinal studies are lacking, little is known about the
clinical course of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome. Symp-
toms appear to abate over time with very gradual dosage reductions.
After an episode, some individuals may prefer to resume medication
indefinitely if tolerated.
Differential Diagnosis
The differential diagnosis of antidepressant discontinuation syn-
drome includes anxiety and depressive disorders, substance use dis-
orders, and tolerance to medications.
Anxiety and depressive disorders. Discontinuation symptoms of-
ten resemble symptoms of a persistent anxiety disorder or a return of
somatic symptoms of depression for which the medication was ini-
tially given.

Medication-Induced Movement Disorders 353
Substance use disorders. Antidepressant discontinuation syn-
drome differs from substance withdrawal in that antidepressants
themselves have no reinforcing or euphoric effects. The medication
dosage has usually not been increased without the clinician’s permis-
sion, and the individual generally does not engage in drug-seeking
behavior to obtain additional medication. Criteria for a substance
use disorder are not met.
Tolerance to medications. Tolerance and discontinuation symp-
toms can occur as a normal physiological response to stopping med-
ication after a substantial duration of exposure. Most cases of
medication tolerance can be managed through carefully controlled
tapering.
Comorbidity
Typically, the individual was initially started on the medication for
a major depressive disorder; the original symptoms may return dur-
ing the discontinuation syndrome.

This category is available for optional use by clinicians to code side
effects of medication (other than movement symptoms) when these
adverse effects become a main focus of clinical attention. Examples
include severe hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, and priapism.

Other Conditions That May Be a
Focus of Clinical Attention
This discussion covers other conditions and problems that
may be a focus of clinical attention or that may otherwise affect the
diagnosis, course, prognosis, or treatment of a patient’s mental dis-
order. These conditions are presented with their corresponding
codes from ICD-9-CM (usually V codes) and ICD-10-CM (usually Z
codes). A condition or problem in this chapter may be coded if it is a
reason for the current visit or helps to explain the need for a test, pro-
cedure, or treatment. Conditions and problems in this chapter may
also be included in the medical record as useful information on cir-
cumstances that may affect the patient’s care, regardless of their rel-
evance to the current visit.
The conditions and problems listed in this chapter are not mental
disorders. Their inclusion in DSM-5 is meant to draw attention to the
scope of additional issues that may be encountered in routine clinical
practice and to provide a systematic listing that may be useful to cli-
nicians in documenting these issues.
Relational Problems
Key relationships, especially intimate adult partner relationships and
parent/caregiver-child relationships, have a significant impact on
the health of the individuals in these relationships. These relation-
ships can be health promoting and protective, neutral, or detrimental
to health outcomes. In the extreme, these close relationships can be
associated with maltreatment or neglect, which has significant med-
ical and psychological consequences for the affected individual. A re-
lational problem may come to clinical attention either as the reason
that the individual seeks health care or as a problem that affects the
course, prognosis, or treatment of the individual’s mental or other
medical disorder.
355

356 Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention
Problems Related to Family Upbringing
V61.20 (Z62.820) Parent-Child Relational Problem
For this category, the term parent is used to refer to one of the child’s
primary caregivers, who may be a biological, adoptive, or foster par-
ent or may be another relative (such as a grandparent) who fulfills a
parental role for the child. This category should be used when the
main focus of clinical attention is to address the quality of the parent-
child relationship or when the quality of the parent-child relation-
ship is affecting the course, prognosis, or treatment of a mental or
other medical disorder. Typically, the parent-child relational prob-
lem is associated with impaired functioning in behavioral, cognitive,
or affective domains. Examples of behavioral problems include inad-
equate parental control, supervision, and involvement with the child;
parental overprotection; excessive parental pressure; arguments that
escalate to threats of physical violence; and avoidance without reso-
lution of problems. Cognitive problems may include negative attri-
butions of the other’s intentions, hostility toward or scapegoating of
the other, and unwarranted feelings of estrangement. Affective prob-
lems may include feelings of sadness, apathy, or anger about the
other individual in the relationship. Clinicians should take into ac-
count the developmental needs of the child and the cultural context.
V61.8 (Z62.891) Sibling Relational Problem
This category should be used when the focus of clinical attention is a pat-
tern of interaction among siblings that is associated with significant im-
pairment in individual or family functioning or with development of
symptoms in one or more of the siblings, or when a sibling relational
problem is affecting the course, prognosis, or treatment of a sibling’s
mental or other medical disorder. This category can be used for either
children or adults if the focus is on the sibling relationship. Siblings in
this context include full, half-, step-, foster, and adopted siblings.
V61.8 (Z62.29) Upbringing Away From Parents
This category should be used when the main focus of clinical atten-
tion pertains to issues regarding a child being raised away from the
parents or when this separate upbringing affects the course, progno-
sis, or treatment of a mental or other medical disorder. The child
could be one who is under state custody and placed in kin care or fos-
ter care. The child could also be one who is living in a nonparental rel-

Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention 357
ative’s home, or with friends, but whose out-of-home placement is
not mandated or sanctioned by the courts. Problems related to a child
living in a group home or orphanage are also included. This category
excludes issues related to V60.6 (Z59.3) children in boarding schools.
V61.29 (Z62.898) Child Affected by Parental Relationship Distress
This category should be used when the focus of clinical attention is
the negative effects of parental relationship discord (e.g., high levels
of conflict, distress, or disparagement) on a child in the family, in-
cluding effects on the child’s mental or other medical disorders.
Other Problems Related to Primary Support Group
V61.10 (Z63.0) Relationship Distress With Spouse or Intimate
Partner
This category should be used when the major focus of the clinical
contact is to address the quality of the intimate (spouse or partner) re-
lationship or when the quality of that relationship is affecting the
course, prognosis, or treatment of a mental or other medical disorder.
Partners can be of the same or different genders. Typically, the rela-
tionship distress is associated with impaired functioning in be-
havioral, cognitive, or affective domains. Examples of behavioral
problems include conflict resolution difficulty, withdrawal, and
overinvolvement. Cognitive problems can manifest as chronic nega-
tive attributions of the other’s intentions or dismissals of the part-
ner’s positive behaviors. Affective problems would include chronic
sadness, apathy, and/or anger about the other partner.
Note: This category excludes clinical encounters for V61.1x
(Z69.1x) mental health services for spousal or partner abuse
problems and V65.49 (Z70.9) sex counseling.
V61.03 (Z63.5) Disruption of Family by Separation or Divorce
This category should be used when partners in an intimate adult cou-
ple are living apart due to relationship problems or are in the process
of divorce.
V61.8 (Z63.8) High Expressed Emotion Level Within Family
Expressed emotion is a construct used as a qualitative measure of the
“amount” of emotion—in particular, hostility, emotional overin-

358 Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention
volvement, and criticism directed toward a family member who is an
identified patient—displayed in the family environment. This cate-
gory should be used when a family’s high level of expressed emotion
is the focus of clinical attention or is affecting the course, prognosis,
or treatment of a family member’s mental or other medical disorder.
V62.82 (Z63.4) Uncomplicated Bereavement
This category can be used when the focus of clinical attention is a nor-
mal reaction to the death of a loved one. As part of their reaction to
such a loss, some grieving individuals present with symptoms char-
acteristic of a major depressive episode—for example, feelings of sad-
ness and associated symptoms such as insomnia, poor appetite, and
weight loss. The bereaved individual typically regards the depressed
mood as “normal,” although the individual may seek professional
help for relief of associated symptoms such as insomnia or anorexia.
The duration and expression of “normal” bereavement vary consid-
erably among different cultural groups. Further guidance in distin-
guishing grief from a major depressive episode is provided in the
criteria for major depressive episode.
Abuse and Neglect
Maltreatment by a family member (e.g., caregiver, intimate adult
partner) or by a nonrelative can be the area of current clinical focus,
or such maltreatment can be an important factor in the assessment
and treatment of patients with mental or other medical disorders. Be-
cause of the legal implications of abuse and neglect, care should be
used in assessing these conditions and assigning these codes. Having
a past history of abuse or neglect can influence diagnosis and treat-
ment response in a number of mental disorders, and may also be
noted along with the diagnosis.
For the following categories, in addition to listings of the con-
firmed or suspected event of abuse or neglect, other codes are pro-
vided for use if the current clinical encounter is to provide mental
health services to either the victim or the perpetrator of the abuse or
neglect. A separate code is also provided for designating a past his-
tory of abuse or neglect.
Coding Note for ICD-10-CM Abuse and Neglect Conditions
For T codes only, the 7th character should be coded as follows:

Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention 359
A (initial encounter)—Use while the patient is receiving ac-
tive treatment for the condition (e.g., surgical treatment,
emergency department encounter, evaluation and treatment
by a new clinician); or
D (subsequent encounter)—Use for encounters after the pa-
tient has received active treatment for the condition and
when he or she is receiving routine care for the condition
during the healing or recovery phase (e.g., cast change or re-
moval, removal of external or internal fixation device, med-
ication adjustment, other aftercare and follow-up visits).
Child Maltreatment and Neglect Problems
Child Physical Abuse
Child physical abuse is nonaccidental physical injury to a child—rang-
ing from minor bruises to severe fractures or death—occurring as a
result of punching, beating, kicking, biting, shaking, throwing, stab-
bing, choking, hitting (with a hand, stick, strap, or other object), burn-
ing, or any other method that is inflicted by a parent, caregiver, or
other individual who has responsibility for the child. Such injury is
considered abuse regardless of whether the caregiver intended to
hurt the child. Physical discipline, such as spanking or paddling, is
not considered abuse as long as it is reasonable and causes no bodily
injury to the child.

Child Sexual Abuse
Child sexual abuse encompasses any sexual act involving a child that
is intended to provide sexual gratification to a parent, caregiver, or
other individual who has responsibility for the child. Sexual abuse
includes activities such as fondling a child’s genitals, penetration, in-
cest, rape, sodomy, and indecent exposure. Sexual abuse also in-
cludes noncontact exploitation of a child by a parent or caregiver—
for example, forcing, tricking, enticing, threatening, or pressuring a
child to participate in acts for the sexual gratification of others, with-
out direct physical contact between child and abuser.

Child neglect is defined as any confirmed or suspected egregious act
or omission by a child’s parent or other caregiver that deprives the
child of basic age-appropriate needs and thereby results, or has rea-
sonable potential to result, in physical or psychological harm to the
child. Child neglect encompasses abandonment; lack of appropriate
supervision; failure to attend to necessary emotional or psychologi-
cal needs; and failure to provide necessary education, medical care,
nourishment, shelter, and/or clothing.

Child Psychological Abuse
Child psychological abuse is nonaccidental verbal or symbolic acts
by a child’s parent or caregiver that result, or have reasonable poten-
tial to result, in significant psychological harm to the child. (Physical
and sexual abusive acts are not included in this category.) Examples
of psychological abuse of a child include berating, disparaging, or
humiliating the child; threatening the child; harming/abandoning—
or indicating that the alleged offender will harm/abandon—people
or things that the child cares about; confining the child (as by tying a
child’s arms or legs together or binding a child to furniture or another
object, or confining a child to a small enclosed area [e.g., a closet]);
egregious scapegoating of the child; coercing the child to inflict pain
on himself or herself; and disciplining the child excessively (i.e., at an
extremely high frequency or duration, even if not at a level of phys-
ical abuse) through physical or nonphysical means.

Spouse or Partner Neglect
Partner neglect is any egregious act or omission in the past year by
one partner that deprives a dependent partner of basic needs and
thereby results, or has reasonable potential to result, in physical or
psychological harm to the dependent partner. This category is used
in the context of relationships in which one partner is extremely de-
pendent on the other partner for care or for assistance in navigating
ordinary daily activities—for example, a partner who is incapable of
self-care owing to substantial physical, psychological/intellectual, or
cultural limitations (e.g., inability to communicate with others and
manage everyday activities due to living in a foreign culture).

Spouse or Partner Abuse, Psychological
Partner psychological abuse encompasses nonaccidental verbal or
symbolic acts by one partner that result, or have reasonable potential
to result, in significant harm to the other partner. This category
should be used when such psychological abuse has occurred during
the past year. Acts of psychological abuse include berating or humil-
iating the victim; interrogating the victim; restricting the victim’s
ability to come and go freely; obstructing the victim’s access to assis-
tance (e.g., law enforcement; legal, protective, or medical resources);
threatening the victim with physical harm or sexual assault; harm-
ing, or threatening to harm, people or things that the victim cares
about; unwarranted restriction of the victim’s access to or use of eco-
nomic resources; isolating the victim from family, friends, or social
support resources; stalking the victim; and trying to make the victim
think that he or she is crazy.

Adult Abuse by Nonspouse or Nonpartner
These categories should be used when an adult has been abused by
another adult who is not an intimate partner. Such maltreatment may
involve acts of physical, sexual, or emotional abuse. Examples of
adult abuse include nonaccidental acts of physical force (e.g., push-
ing/shoving, scratching, slapping, throwing something that could
hurt, punching, biting) that have resulted—or have reasonable po-
tential to result—in physical harm or have caused significant fear;
forced or coerced sexual acts; and verbal or symbolic acts with the po-
tential to cause psychological harm (e.g., berating or humiliating
the person; interrogating the person; restricting the person’s ability
to come and go freely; obstructing the person’s access to assistance;
threatening the person; harming or threatening to harm people or
things that the person cares about; restricting the person’s access to or
use of economic resources; isolating the person from family, friends,
or social support resources; stalking the person; trying to make the
person think that he or she is crazy). Acts for the purpose of physi-
cally protecting oneself or the other person are excluded.

in the work environment; uncongenial or hostile work environments;
other psychosocial stressors related to work; and any other problems
related to employment and/or occupation.
Housing and Economic Problems

home, and retiring.
V60.3 (Z60.2) Problem Related to Living Alone
This category should be used when a problem associated with living
alone is the focus of clinical attention or has an impact on the individ-
ual’s treatment or prognosis. Examples of such problems include

cus of treatment or directly affects the course, prognosis, or treatment
of a mental or other medical disorder. Examples of lifestyle problems
include lack of physical exercise, inappropriate diet, high-risk sexual
behavior, and poor sleep hygiene. A problem that is attributable to a
symptom of a mental disorder should not be coded unless that prob-
lem is a specific focus of treatment or directly affects the course, prog-
nosis, or treatment of the individual. In such cases, both the mental
disorder and the lifestyle problem should be coded.
V71.01 (Z72.811) Adult Antisocial Behavior
This category can be used when the focus of clinical attention is adult an-
tisocial behavior that is not due to a mental disorder (e.g., conduct dis-
order, antisocial personality disorder). Examples include the behavior of
some professional thieves, racketeers, or dealers in illegal substances.

Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention 373
V71.02 (Z72.810) Child or Adolescent Antisocial Behavior
This category can be used when the focus of clinical attention is anti-
social behavior in a child or adolescent that is not due to a mental dis-
order (e.g., intermittent explosive disorder, conduct disorder).
Examples include isolated antisocial acts by children or adolescents
(not a pattern of antisocial behavior).
Problems Related to Access to Medical
and Other Health Care
V63.9 (Z75.3) Unavailability or Inaccessibility of Health
Care Facilities
V63.8 (Z75.4) Unavailability or Inaccessibility of Other
Helping Agencies
Nonadherence to Medical Treatment
V15.81 (Z91.19) Nonadherence to Medical Treatment
This category can be used when the focus of clinical attention is non-
adherence to an important aspect of treatment for a mental disorder
or another medical condition. Reasons for such nonadherence may
include discomfort resulting from treatment (e.g., medication side ef-
fects), expense of treatment, personal value judgments or religious or
cultural beliefs about the proposed treatment, age-related debility,
and the presence of a mental disorder (e.g., schizophrenia, personal-
ity disorder). This category should be used only when the problem is
sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention and
does not meet diagnostic criteria for psychological factors affecting
other medical conditions.
278.00 (E66.9) Overweight or Obesity
This category may be used when overweight or obesity is a focus of
clinical attention.
V65.2 (Z76.5) Malingering
The essential feature of malingering is the intentional production of
false or grossly exaggerated physical or psychological symptoms,
motivated by external incentives such as avoiding military duty,
avoiding work, obtaining financial compensation, evading criminal
prosecution, or obtaining drugs. Under some circumstances, ma-
lingering may represent adaptive behavior—for example, feigning

374 Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention
illness while a captive of the enemy during wartime. Malingering
should be strongly suspected if any combination of the following is
noted:
1. Medicolegal context of presentation (e.g., the individual is
referred by an attorney to the clinician for examination, or the
individual self-refers while litigation or criminal charges are
pending).
2. Marked discrepancy between the individual’s claimed stress or
disability and the objective findings and observations.
3. Lack of cooperation during the diagnostic evaluation and in
complying with the prescribed treatment regimen.
4. The presence of antisocial personality disorder.
Malingering differs from factitious disorder in that the motiva-
tion for the symptom production in malingering is an external incen-
tive, whereas in factitious disorder external incentives are absent.
Malingering is differentiated from conversion disorder and somatic
symptom–related mental disorders by the intentional production of
symptoms and by the obvious external incentives associated with it.
Definite evidence of feigning (such as clear evidence that loss of func-
tion is present during the examination but not at home) would sug-
gest a diagnosis of factitious disorder if the individual’s apparent aim
is to assume the sick role, or malingering if it is to obtain an incentive,
such as money.
V40.31 (Z91.83) Wandering Associated With a Mental Disorder
This category is used for individuals with a mental disorder whose
desire to walk about leads to significant clinical management or
safety concerns. For example, individuals with major neurocognitive
or neurodevelopmental disorders may experience a restless urge to
wander that places them at risk for falls and causes them to leave su-
pervised settings without needed accompaniment. This category ex-
cludes individuals whose intent is to escape an unwanted housing
situation (e.g., children who are running away from home, patients
who no longer wish to remain in the hospital) or those who walk or
pace as a result of medication-induced akathisia.
Coding note: First code associated mental disorder (e.g., major neu-
rocognitive disorder, autism spectrum disorder), then code V40.31
(Z91.83) wandering associated with [specific mental disorder].

Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention 375
V62.89 (R41.83) Borderline Intellectual Functioning
This category can be used when an individual’s borderline intellectual
functioning is the focus of clinical attention or has an impact on the
individual’s treatment or prognosis. Differentiating borderline intel-
lectual functioning and mild intellectual disability (intellectual devel-
opmental disorder) requires careful assessment of intellectual and
adaptive functions and their discrepancies, particularly in the pres-
ence of co-occurring mental disorders that may affect patient compli-
ance with standardized testing procedures (e.g., schizophrenia or
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder with severe impulsivity).
