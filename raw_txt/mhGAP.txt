Glossary
Activities of daily living A concept of functioning – activities of daily living are basic activities that are
(ADLs) necessary for independent living, including eating, bathing and toileting. This
concept has several assessment tools to determine an individual’s ability to
perform the activity with or without assistance.
Agitation Marked restlessness and excessive motor activity, accompanied by anxiety.
Akathisia A subjective sense of restlessness, often accompanied by observed excessive
movements (e.g. fidgety movements of the legs, rocking from foot to foot,
pacing, inability to sit or stand still).
Akinesia The absence or lack of voluntary movement. A state of difficulty initiating
movements or changing from one motor pattern to another that is associated
with Parkinson’s disease.
Altered mental state A changed level of awareness or mental state that falls short of
unconsciousness which is often induced by substance intake or other mental or
neurological conditions. Examples include confusion and disorientation. See
delirium and confusional state.
Alzheimer’s disease A primary degenerative cerebral disease of unknown etiology in the majority of
cases with characteristic neuropathological and neurochemical features. The
disorder is usually insidious in onset and develops slowly but steadily over a
period of several years.
Anticholinergic side-effects Anticholinergic medicines block the effects of acetylcholine at muscarinic
receptors. Anticholinergic side-effects include dryness of the mouth, urinary
frequency or retention, palpitations and sinus tachycardia.
Ataxia Failure of muscular coordination. People with ataxia have problems with
coordination because parts of the nervous system that control movement and
balance are affected. Ataxia may affect the fingers, hands, arms, legs, body,
speech and eye movements.
Autonomy The perceived ability to control, cope with and make personal decisions about
how one lives on a daily basis, according to one’s own rules and preferences.
Note: Some of these terms are not used in this guideline document but are used in the accompanying evidence
profiles, which are available online.

Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) guideline for mental, neurological and substance use disorders
Behavioural activation Psychological treatment that focuses on improving mood by engaging again in
activities that are task-oriented and used to be enjoyable, in spite of current low
mood. It may be used as a stand-alone treatment, and it is also a component of
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).
Bereavement A process of loss, grief and recovery, usually associated with death.
Cerebrovascular accident A sudden disturbance of cerebral function attributable to vascular disease,
principally thrombosis, haemorrhage or embolism.
Cognitive Mental processes associated with thinking. These include reasoning,
remembering, judgement, problem-solving and planning.
Cognitive behavioural Psychological treatment that combines cognitive components (aimed at
therapy (CBT) thinking differently, e.g. through identifying and challenging unrealistic
negative thoughts) and behavioural components (aimed at doing things
differently, e.g. by helping the person to do more rewarding activities).
Comorbid, comorbidity Describing diseases or disorders that exist simultaneously.
Confidentiality Privacy in the context of privileged communication (e.g. patient–doctor
consultations) and medical records is safeguarded.
Confusion, confusional state A state of impaired consciousness associated with acute or chronic cerebral
organic disease. Clinically, it is characterized by disorientation, slowness of
mental processes with scanty association of ideas, apathy, lack of initiative,
fatigue and poor attention. In mild confusional states, rational responses and
behaviour may be provoked by examination, but more severe degrees of the
disorder render the individual unable to retain contact with the environment.
Contingency management A structured method of rewarding certain desired behaviours, such as attending
therapy treatment and avoiding harmful substance use. Rewards for desired behaviours
are reduced over time as the natural rewards become established.
Convulsion, convulsive Clinical or subclinical disturbance of cortical function due to a sudden,
movement abnormal, excessive and disorganized discharge of brain cells (see
seizure). Clinical manifestations include abnormal motor, sensory and
psychic phenomena.
Delirium Transient fluctuating mental state characterized by disturbed attention (i.e.
reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain and shift attention) and awareness (i.e.
reduced orientation to the environment) that develops over a short period
of time and tends to fluctuate during the course of a day. It is accompanied
by (other) disturbances of perception, memory, thinking, emotions or
psychomotor functions. It may result from acute organic causes such as
infections, medication, metabolic abnormalities, substance intoxication or
substance withdrawal.

Glossary
Delusion Fixed belief that is contrary to available evidence. It cannot be changed by
rational argument and it is not accepted by other members of the person’s
culture or subculture (i.e. it is not an aspect of religious faith).
Detoxification The process by which an individual is withdrawn from the effects of a
psychoactive substance. Also referring to a clinical procedure, the withdrawal
process is carried out in a safe and effective manner, such that withdrawal
symptoms are minimized.
Disability Any restriction or lack (resulting from an impairment) of ability to perform
an activity in the manner, or within the range, considered to be normal for a
human being. The term "disability" reflects the consequences of impairment in
terms of functional performance and activity by the individual.
Disinhibited behaviour, Lack of restraint manifested in disregard for social conventions, impulsivity and
disinhibition poor risk assessment. It can affect motor, emotional, cognitive and perceptual
aspects of a person’s functioning.
Disorganized/disordered A disturbance in the associative thought process typically manifested in speech
thinking in which the person shifts suddenly from one topic to another that is unrelated
or minimally related to the first. The individual gives no indication of being
aware of the disconnectedness or illogicality of his or her thinking.
Disorganized behaviour Behaviour including posture, gait and other activity that is unpredictable or not
goal-directed (e.g. shouting at strangers on the street).
Distractibility Difficulty concentrating and focusing on tasks; attention is easily diverted by
extraneous stimuli.
Dystonia Sustained muscle contraction or involuntary movements that can lead to fixed
abnormal postures. See tardive dyskinesia.
Eclampsia Any condition affecting pregnant women, characterized by seizure or
convulsions newly arising in pregnancy. The condition is often associated with
pregnancy-induced hypertension, convulsions, seizure, anxiety, epigastric pain,
severe headache, blurred vision, proteinuria and oedema that may occur during
pregnancy, labour or the puerperium.
Elevated mood A positive mood state typically characterized by increased energy and self-
esteem which may be out of proportion to the individual’s life circumstances.
Extrapyramidal side-effects/ Abnormalities in muscle movement, mostly caused by antipsychotic
symptoms (EPS) medication. These include muscle tremors, stiffness, spasms and/or akathisia.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome Life-threatening skin condition characterized by painful skin peeling, ulcers,
blisters and crusting of mucocutaneous tissues such as mouth, lips, throat,
tongue, eyes and genitals, sometimes associated with fever. It is most often
caused by a severe reaction to medications, especially antiseizure medicines.
Stigma A distinguishing mark establishing a demarcation between the stigmatized
persona and others attributing negative characteristics to this person.
The stigma attached to mental illness often leads to social exclusion and

Recommendation (update): For children 6 years old and above and adolescents who have an attention

considered, provided that:
y ADHD symptoms are still causing persistent significant impairment in at
least one domain of functioning (education, interpersonal relationships,

been informed about ADHD treatment options and supported
in decision-making;
y methylphenidate prescription is made by, or in consultation with,
a specialist.

6 The term cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with a trauma focus is synonymous with the term trauma-focused CBT (TF-CBT), as used in the
United Kingdom’s National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health guidance (79) and in Cochrane reviews (e.g. Bisson and Andrew 2005 [80]).
It is noted that in the traumatic stress literature the latter term also has a more narrow definition for a very specific and widely disseminated

Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) guideline for mental, neurological and substance use disorders
EPI3. For adults and children with epilepsy, which antiseizure
medicines are effective and safe?
Recommendation (update): 3.1 Generalized onset seizures:
Monotherapy with lamotrigine or levetiracetam, or valproic acid (sodium
valproate), should be offered as first-line treatment for generalized onset
seizures in men/boys and women/girls who are not of childbearing potential.
In women and girls of childbearing potential with generalized onset seizures,
lamotrigine or levetiracetam should be offered as first-line monotherapy.
If the first monotherapy is not successful for generalized onset seizures, an
alternative first-line monotherapy should be tried.
Valproic acid (sodium valproate) is not recommended in women and
girls of childbearing potential owing to the high risk of birth defects and
neurodevelopmental disorders in children exposed to valproic acid (sodium
valproate) in the womb.
If lamotrigine, levetiracetam and valproic acid (sodium valproate) are not
available for generalized onset seizures, monotherapy with either phenytoin
or phenobarbital can be considered.
Strength of recommendation: Strong
Certainty of evidence: High
3.2 Focal onset seizures:
Monotherapy with lamotrigine or levetiracetam should be offered as first-line
treatment for focal onset seizures in children and adults with epilepsy.
If neither lamotrigine nor levetiracetam are available, then carbamazepine
should be used as an alternate first-line treatment for focal onset seizures in
children and adults with epilepsy.
If the first monotherapy is not successful for focal onset seizures, an
alternative first-line monotherapy should be tried.
Lacosamide should be offered as a second-line monotherapy for focal onset
seizures if none of the first-line medicines are effective.
If antiseizure medicine monotherapy is unsuccessful in people with
generalized onset seizures or focal onset seizures, prompt referral should be
made to a specialist for consideration of other treatment options.
Strength of recommendation: Strong
Certainty of evidence: High

EPI4. What is the effectiveness and safety of antiseizure medicines
in women of childbearing potential?
Recommendation (update): 4.1 The efficacy of antiseizure medicines (ASMs) is not thought to differ
in males and females. As such, this recommendation builds on EPI3 and
focuses on the medicines that are now being preferentially recommended as
therapeutic options.
In women and girls with epilepsy who are of childbearing potential,
lamotrigine or levetiracetam should be offered as first-line monotherapy for
both generalized onset seizures and focal onset seizures.
Women with epilepsy should have seizures controlled as well as possible with
the minimum dose of ASMs taken in monotherapy, wherever possible.
Valproic acid (sodium valproate) is not recommended in women and girls of
childbearing potential because of potential harm to the fetus.
Strength of recommendation: Strong
Certainty of evidence: Very low
4.2 Standard breastfeeding recommendations remain appropriate for
women with epilepsy taking the ASMs included in this review (phenobarbital,

BOX 3.2 Investigated psychological interventions and definitions
The investigated interventions included: family psychoeducation, integrated cognitive and interpersonal
therapy, individual psychological interventions and group psychological interventions, as listed and
defined below.
Family psychoeducation (carers): Intervention for the family only. Psychoeducation about bipolar disorder
and its treatment, dealing with one’s own functioning (stress and other health risks) and practical advice.
Integrated cognitive and interpersonal therapy: Individuals could choose the group or individual
intervention. Psychoeducation, identification of early warning signs, behavioural strategies for coping with
symptoms, cognitive strategies, affect-regulation techniques, social network analysis and identification of
interpersonal patterns and strategies.
Individual psychological interventions:
▶ Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT): Psychoeducation, identifying and modifying dysfunctional and negative
thoughts, underlying maladaptive assumptions and beliefs, problem-solving training and strategies for early
detection of mood episodes.
▶ Online psychoeducation: Online interactive programme addressing topics such as the causes of bipolar
disorder, diagnosis, treatments, role of lifestyle (changes) and the importance of support.
▶ Individual psychoeducation: Education on bipolar disorder, causative factors, clinical symptoms and early
warning signs, medicine side-effects and coping strategies for mood changes.
▶ Medicine adherence therapy: Modified cognitive-behavioural intervention aimed at altering cognitions and
behaviours that interfere with compliance.
Group psychological interventions:
▶ Group psychoeducation: Interactive group sessions covering illness and treatment education, symptom
monitoring and early detection, treatment adherence, illness management skills, coping strategies and
problem solving.
▶ Group CBT: Psychoeducation, identifying and modifying dysfunctional and negative thoughts, underlying
maladaptive assumptions and beliefs, problem-solving training and strategies for early detection of
mood episodes.
▶ Group mindfulness therapy: Psychoeducation, mindfulness meditation (observations of thoughts, feelings
and bodily reactions) practice and cognitive therapy regarding depression.
▶ Group social cognition and interaction training: Emotional training (definition of emotions, facial expression
training, understanding of paranoid symptoms as an emotion), role-play social situations (distinguishing
facts from guesses, jumping to conclusions, understanding bad events), and integration of learning.
▶ Group dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT): Psychoeducation about bipolar disorder and treatment. Training
of skills: states of mind, reducing vulnerability to emotions, nonjudgemental stance, acceptance, distracting,
