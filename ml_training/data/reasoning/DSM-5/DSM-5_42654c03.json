The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication. 2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in Criterion A. C. The disturbance is not better explained by a bipolar or related disor- der that is not substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent bipolar or related disorder could include the following: The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medica- tion use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting the existence of an independent non-substance/medication- induced bipolar and related disorder (e.g., a history of recur- rent non-substance/medication-related episodes). D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medication]-induced bipolar and related disorders are in- dicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder pres- ent for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced bipolar and related disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced bipolar and related disorder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine- induced bipolar and related disorder”). If a moderate or severe sub- stance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced bipolar and related disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clini- cian should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid 78 Bipolar and Related Disorders substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disor- der (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the sub- stance-induced bipolar and related disorder. ICD-10-CM With use With use disorder, Without disorder, moderate use ICD-9-CM mild or severe disorder Alcohol 291.89 F10.14 F10.24 F10.94 Phencyclidine 292.84 F16.14 F16.24 F16.94 Other hallucinogen 292.84 F16.14 F16.24 F16.94 Sedative, hypnotic, 292.84 F13.14 F13.24 F13.94 or anxiolytic Amphetamine (or 292.84 F15.14 F15.24 F15.94 other stimulant) Cocaine 292.84 F14.14 F14.24 F14.94 Other (or unknown) 292.84 F19.14 F19.24 F19.94 substance Specify if (see Table 1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addic- tive Disorders” for diagnoses associated with substance class): With onset during intoxication: If the criteria are met for intox- ication with the substance and the symptoms develop during in- toxication. With onset during withdrawal: If criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal. Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder 79 Recording Procedures ICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the bipolar mood symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is un- known, the category “unknown substance” should be used. The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the substance- induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of irritable symptoms occurring during intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.84 cocaine-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during intoxication. An additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe cocaine use disorder is also given. When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of bipolar mood symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., 292.84 methylphe- nidate-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during in- toxication; 292.84 dexamethasone-induced bipolar and related disor- der, with onset during intoxication). ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced bipo- lar and related disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., co- caine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the bipolar mood symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table in- cluded in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used. When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid sub- stance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word “with,” followed by the name of the substance-induced bipolar and 80 Bipolar and Related Disorders related disorder, followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal). For example, in the case of irritable symptoms occurring during intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is F14.24 severe co- caine use disorder with cocaine-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during intoxication. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe cocaine use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced bi- polar and related disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accom- panying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F15.94 amphetamine- induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during intoxica- tion). When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of bipolar mood symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., F15.24 severe methylphenidate use disorder with methylphenidate-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during intoxication; F19.94 dexamethasone-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during intoxication). Bipolar and Related Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition A. A prominent and persistent period of abnormally elevated, ex- pansive, or irritable mood and abnormally increased activity or energy that predominates in the clinical picture. B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or lab- oratory findings that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiolog- ical consequence of another medical condition. C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder. D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impair- ment in social, occupational, or other important areas of function- ing, or necessitates hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others, or there are psychotic features. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code for bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition is 293.83, which is assigned regard- Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder 81 less of the specifier. The ICD-10-CM code depends on the specifier (see below). Specify if: (F06.33) With manic features: Full criteria are not met for a manic or hypomanic episode. (F06.33) With manic- or hypomanic-like episode: Full criteria are met except Criterion D for a manic episode or except Crite- rion F for a hypomanic episode. (F06.34) With mixed features: Symptoms of depression are also present but do not predominate in the clinical picture. Coding note: Include the name of the other medical condition in the name of the mental disorder (e.g., 293.83 [F06.33] bipolar disorder due to hyperthyroidism, with manic features). The other medical con- dition should also be coded and listed separately immediately before the bipolar and related disorder due to the medical condition (e.g., 242.90 [E05.90] hyperthyroidism; 293.83 [F06.33] bipolar disorder due to hyperthyroidism, with manic features). Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder 296.89 (F31.89) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character- istic of a bipolar and related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important ar- eas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the bipolar and related disorders diagnostic class. The other specified bipolar and related disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any spe- cific bipolar and related disorder. This is done by recording “other specified bipolar and related disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “short-duration cyclothymia”). Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation include the following: 82 Bipolar and Related Disorders 1. Short-duration hypomanic episodes (2–3 days) and major depressive episodes: A lifetime history of one or more major depressive episodes in individuals whose presentation has never met full criteria for a manic or hypomanic episode but who have experienced two or more episodes of short-duration hypomania that meet the full symptomatic criteria for a hypomanic episode but that only last for 2–3 days. The episodes of hypomanic symp- toms do not overlap in time with the major depressive episodes, so the disturbance does not meet criteria for major depressive episode, with mixed features. 2. Hypomanic episodes with insufficient symptoms and major depressive episodes: A lifetime history of one or more major depressive episodes in individuals whose presentation has never met full criteria for a manic or hypomanic episode but who have experienced one or more episodes of hypomania that do not meet full symptomatic criteria (i.e., at least 4 consecutive days of elevated mood and one or two of the other symptoms of a hypo- manic episode, or irritable mood and two or three of the other symptoms of a hypomanic episode). The episodes of hypomanic symptoms do not overlap in time with the major depressive epi- sodes, so the disturbance does not meet criteria for major de- pressive episode, with mixed features. 3. Hypomanic episode without prior major depressive epi- sode: One or more hypomanic episodes in an individual whose presentation has never met full criteria for a major depressive ep- isode or a manic episode. If this occurs in an individual with an established diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder (dysthy- mia), both diagnoses can be concurrently applied during the pe- riods when the full criteria for a hypomanic episode are met. 4. Short-duration cyclothymia (less than 24 months): Multiple episodes of hypomanic symptoms that do not meet criteria for a hypomanic episode and multiple episodes of depressive symp- toms that do not meet criteria for a major depressive episode that persist over a period of less than 24 months (less than 12 months for children or adolescents) in an individual whose presentation has never met full criteria for a major depressive, manic, or hypo- Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorder 83 manic episode and does not meet criteria for any psychotic dis- order. During the course of the disorder, the hypomanic or depres- sive symptoms are present for more days than not, the individual has not been without symptoms for more than 2 months at a time, and the symptoms cause clinically significant distress or im- pairment. Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorder 296.80 (F31.9) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character- istic of a bipolar and related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important ar- eas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the bipolar and related disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified bipolar and related disorder category is used in situ- ations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific bipolar and related disorder, and in- cludes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings). Specifiers for Bipolar and Related Disorders Specify if: With anxious distress: The presence of at least two of the fol- lowing symptoms during the majority of days of the current or most recent episode of mania, hypomania, or depression: 1. Feeling keyed up or tense. 2. Feeling unusually restless. 3. Difficulty concentrating because of worry. 4. Fear that something awful may happen. 5. Feeling that the individual might lose control of himself or herself.",
