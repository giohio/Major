Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handi- capping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble). 5. Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed). 6. After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (“chasing” one’s losses). 7. Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling. 8. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or ed- ucational or career opportunity because of gambling. 9. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate finan- cial situations caused by gambling. B. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic epi- sode. Specify if: Episodic: Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months. Persistent: Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diag- nostic criteria for multiple years. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months. In sustained remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of 12 months or longer. Specify current severity: Mild: 4–5 criteria met. Moderate: 6–7 criteria met. Severe: 8–9 criteria met. This page intentionally left blank Neurocognitive Disorders Neurocognitive Domains The criteria for the various neurocognitive disorders are all based on defined cognitive domains. Table 1 provides for each of the key do- mains a working definition, examples of symptoms or observations regarding impairments in everyday activities, and examples of as- sessments. The domains thus defined, along with guidelines for clin- ical thresholds, form the basis on which the neurocognitive disorders, their levels, and their subtypes may be diagnosed. Additional infor- mation is provided in DSM-5. 285 286 Neurocognitive Disorders TABLE 1 Neurocognitive domains Cognitive domain Examples of symptoms or observations Examples of assessments Complex attention Major: Has increased difficulty in environ- Sustained attention: Maintenance of attention over (sustained atten- ments with multiple stimuli (TV, radio, time (e.g., pressing a button every time a tone is tion, divided conversation); is easily distracted by com- heard, and over a period of time). attention, peting events in the environment.
