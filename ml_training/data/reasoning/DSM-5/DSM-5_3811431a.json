A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the inhalant substance, use it, or recover from its effects. 4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the inhalant sub- stance. 5. Recurrent use of the inhalant substance resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home. 6. Continued use of the inhalant substance despite having per- sistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of its use. 7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are giv- en up or reduced because of use of the inhalant substance. 8. Recurrent use of the inhalant substance in situations in which it is physically hazardous. 9. Use of the inhalant substance is continued despite knowl- edge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psy- chological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by the substance. 10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: a. A need for markedly increased amounts of the inhalant substance to achieve intoxication or desired effect. b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the inhalant substance. Specify the particular inhalant: When possible, the particular sub- stance involved should be named (e.g., “solvent use disorder”). Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for inhalant use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for inhalant use disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the inhalant substance,” may be met). In sustained remission: After full criteria for inhalant use disor- der were previously met, none of the criteria for inhalant use dis- order have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the inhalant substance,” may be met). 254 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders Specify if: In a controlled environment: This additional specifier is used if the individual is in an environment where access to inhalant sub- stances is restricted. Coding based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If an inhalant intoxication or another inhalant-induced mental disorder is also present, do not use the codes below for inhalant use disorder. Instead, the comorbid inhalant use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the inhalant-induced disorder code (see the coding note for inhalant intoxication or a specific inhalant-induced mental disor- der). For example, if there is comorbid inhalant-induced depressive disorder and inhalant use disorder, only the inhalant-induced depres- sive disorder code is given, with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid inhalant use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe: F18.14 for mild inhalant use disorder with inhalant-induced depres- sive disorder or F18.24 for a moderate or severe inhalant use disor- der with inhalant-induced depressive disorder. Specify current severity: 305.90 (F18.10) Mild: Presence of 2–3 symptoms. 304.60 (F18.20) Moderate: Presence of 4–5 symptoms. 304.60 (F18.20) Severe: Presence of 6 or more symptoms. Inhalant Intoxication A. Recent intended or unintended short-term, high-dose exposure to inhalant substances, including volatile hydrocarbons such as toluene or gasoline. B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., belligerence, assaultiveness, apathy, impaired judgment) that developed during, or shortly after, exposure to in- halants. C. Two (or more) of the following signs or symptoms developing during, or shortly after, inhalant use or exposure: 1. Dizziness. 2. Nystagmus. 3. Incoordination.",
