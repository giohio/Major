The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Specify if: With obsessive-compulsive disorder–like symptoms: If ob- sessive-compulsive disorder–like symptoms predominate in the clinical presentation. With appearance preoccupations: If preoccupation with per- ceived appearance defects or flaws predominates in the clinical presentation. With hoarding symptoms: If hoarding predominates in the clin- ical presentation. With hair-pulling symptoms: If hair pulling predominates in the clinical presentation. With skin-picking symptoms: If skin picking predominates in the clinical presentation. Coding note: Include the name of the other medical condition in the name of the mental disorder (e.g., 294.8 [F06.8] obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to cerebral infarction). The other medical con- dition should be coded and listed separately immediately before the obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to the medical condi- tion (e.g., 438.89 [I69.398] cerebral infarction; 294.8 [F06.8] obses- sive-compulsive and related disorder due to cerebral infarction). Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder 300.3 (F42) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character- istic of an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder that cause clin- ically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders diagnostic class. The other specified obsessive- Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder 139 compulsive and related disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific obsessive- compulsive and related disorder. This is done by recording “other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “body-focused repetitive behavior disorder”). Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation include the following: 1. Body dysmorphic–like disorder with actual flaws: This is similar to body dysmorphic disorder except that the defects or flaws in physical appearance are clearly observable by others (i.e., they are more noticeable than “slight”). In such cases, the preoccupation with these flaws is clearly excessive and causes significant impairment or distress. 2. Body dysmorphic–like disorder without repetitive behav- iors: Presentations that meet body dysmorphic disorder except that the individual has not performed repetitive behaviors or mental acts in response to the appearance concerns. 3. Body-focused repetitive behavior disorder: This is character- ized by recurrent body-focused repetitive behaviors (e.g., nail bit- ing, lip biting, cheek chewing) and repeated attempts to decrease or stop the behaviors. These symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning and are not better explained by trichotilloma- nia (hair-pulling disorder), excoriation (skin-picking) disorder, ste- reotypic movement disorder, or nonsuicidal self-injury. 4. Obsessional jealousy: This is characterized by nondelusional preoccupation with a partner’s perceived infidelity. The preoccu- pations may lead to repetitive behaviors or mental acts in re- sponse to the infidelity concerns; they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning; and they are not better explained by another mental disorder such as delusional disorder, jealous type, or par- anoid personality disorder. 5. Shubo-kyofu: A variant of taijin kyofusho (see “Glossary of Cul- tural Concepts of Distress” in the Appendix to DSM-5) that is sim- ilar to body dysmorphic disorder and is characterized by excessive fear of having a bodily deformity. 140 Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders 6. Koro: Related to dhat syndrome (see “Glossary of Cultural Con- cepts of Distress” in the Appendix to DSM-5), an episode of sud- den and intense anxiety that the penis (or the vulva and nipples in females) will recede into the body, possibly leading to death. 7. Jikoshu-kyofu: A variant of taijin kyofusho (see “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress” in the Appendix to DSM-5) char- acterized by fear of having an offensive body odor (also termed olfactory reference syndrome). Unspecified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder 300.3 (F42) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character- istic of an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder that cause clin- ically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the obsessive-compulsive and relat- ed disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder category is used in situations in which the clini- cian chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).",
