  "text": "Depressive Disorders Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder 296.99 (F34.8) A. Severe recurrent temper outbursts manifested verbally (e.g., ver- bal rages) and/or behaviorally (e.g., physical aggression toward people or property) that are grossly out of proportion in intensity or duration to the situation or provocation. B. The temper outbursts are inconsistent with developmental level. C. The temper outbursts occur, on average, three or more times per week. D. The mood between temper outbursts is persistently irritable or angry most of the day, nearly every day, and is observable by others (e.g., parents, teachers, peers). E. Criteria A–D have been present for 12 or more months. Through- out that time, the individual has not had a period lasting 3 or more consecutive months without all of the symptoms in Criteria A–D. F. Criteria A and D are present in at least two of three settings (i.e., at home, at school, with peers) and are severe in at least one of these. G. The diagnosis should not be made for the first time before age 6 years or after age 18 years. H. By history or observation, the age at onset of Criteria A–E is be- fore 10 years. I. There has never been a distinct period lasting more than 1 day during which the full symptom criteria, except duration, for a manic or hypomanic episode have been met. Note: Developmentally appropriate mood elevation, such as oc- curs in the context of a highly positive event or its anticipation, should not be considered as a symptom of mania or hypomania. J. The behaviors do not occur exclusively during an episode of ma- jor depressive disorder and are not better explained by another 93 94 Depressive Disorders mental disorder (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety disorder, persistent depres- sive disorder [dysthymia]). Note: This diagnosis cannot coexist with oppositional defiant dis- order, intermittent explosive disorder, or bipolar disorder, though it can coexist with others, including major depressive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and sub- stance use disorders. Individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and oppositional defiant disorder should only be given the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. If an individual has ever experienced a manic or hypomanic episode, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not be assigned. K. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or to another medical or neurological condition. Major Depressive Disorder A. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present dur- ing the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure. Note: Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to another medical condition. 1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indi- cated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tear- ful). (Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.) 2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation). 3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or de- crease or increase in appetite nearly every day. (Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.) 4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day. Major Depressive Disorder 95 5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (ob- servable by others, not merely subjective feelings of rest- lessness or being slowed down). 6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day. 7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self- reproach or guilt about being sick). 8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as ob- served by others). 9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. B. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. C. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or to another medical condition. Note: Criteria A–C represent a major depressive episode. Note: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial ru- in, losses from a natural disaster, a serious medical illness or disabil- ity) may include the feelings of intense sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Criterion A, which may resemble a depressive episode. Although such symptoms may be understandable or considered appropriate to the loss, the presence of a major depressive episode in addition to the normal re- sponse to a significant loss should also be carefully considered. This decision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical judgment based on the individual’s history and the cultural norms for the expression of distress in the context of loss.1 D. The occurrence of the major depressive episode is not better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizo- phreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified and un- specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. E. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode. Note: This exclusion does not apply if all of the manic-like or hy- pomanic-like episodes are substance-induced or are attributable to the physiological effects of another medical condition.",
