In sustained remission: After full criteria for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder were previously met, none of the crite- ria for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic,” may be met). Specify if: In a controlled environment: This additional specifier is used if the individual is in an environment where access to sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics is restricted. Coding based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication; sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal; or another sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic- induced mental disorder is also present, do not use the codes below for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder. Instead, the comorbid sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced disorder (see the coding note for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication; sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal; or a specific sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced mental disorder). For example, if there is comorbid sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced depressive dis- order and sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, only the sed- ative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced depressive disorder code is given, with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe: F13.14 for mild sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder with sed- ative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced depressive disorder or F13.24 for a moderate or severe sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder with sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced depressive disorder. 264 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders Specify current severity: 305.40 (F13.10) Mild: Presence of 2–3 symptoms. 304.10 (F13.20) Moderate: Presence of 4–5 symptoms. 304.10 (F13.20) Severe: Presence of 6 or more symptoms. Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication A. Recent use of a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic. B. Clinically significant maladaptive behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., inappropriate sexual or aggressive behavior, mood lability, impaired judgment) that developed during, or shortly after, sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use. C. One (or more) of the following signs or symptoms developing during, or shortly after, sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use: 1. Slurred speech. 2. Incoordination. 3. Unsteady gait. 4. Nystagmus. 5. Impairment in cognition (e.g., attention, memory). 6. Stupor or coma. D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disor- der, including intoxication with another substance. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.89. The ICD-10-CM code depends on whether there is a comorbid sedative, hypnotic, or anx- iolytic use disorder. If a mild sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use dis- order is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F13.129, and if a moderate or severe sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F13.229. If there is no comorbid sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F13.929.",
