Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day. 7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self- reproach or guilt about being sick). 8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as ob- served by others). 9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. B. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. C. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or to another medical condition. Note: Criteria A–C represent a major depressive episode. Note: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial ru- in, losses from a natural disaster, a serious medical illness or disabil- ity) may include the feelings of intense sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Criterion A, which may resemble a depressive episode. Although such symptoms may be understandable or considered appropriate to the loss, the presence of a major depressive episode in addition to the normal re- sponse to a significant loss should also be carefully considered. This decision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical judgment based on the individual’s history and the cultural norms for the expression of distress in the context of loss.1 D. The occurrence of the major depressive episode is not better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizo- phreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified and un- specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. E. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode. Note: This exclusion does not apply if all of the manic-like or hy- pomanic-like episodes are substance-induced or are attributable to the physiological effects of another medical condition. 96 Depressive Disorders Coding and Recording Procedures The diagnostic code for major depressive disorder is based on whether this is a single or recurrent episode, current severity, pres- ence of psychotic features, and remission status. Current severity and psychotic features are only indicated if full criteria are currently met for a major depressive episode. Remission specifiers are only in- dicated if the full criteria are not currently met for a major depressive episode. Codes are as follows: Severity/course specifier Single episode Recurrent episode* Mild (p. 114) 296.21 (F32.0) 296.31 (F33.0) Moderate (p. 114) 296.22 (F32.1) 296.32 (F33.1) Severe (p. 114) 296.23 (F32.2) 296.33 (F33.2) With psychotic features** 296.24 (F32.3) 296.34 (F33.3) (p. 111) In partial remission (p. 114) 296.25 (F32.4) 296.35 (F33.41) 1In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is useful to consider that in grief the predominant affect is feelings of emptiness and loss, while in an MDE, it is persistent depressed mood and the inability to anticipate happiness or pleasure. The dysphoria in grief is likely to decrease in intensity over days to weeks and occurs in waves, the so-called pangs of grief. These waves tend to be associated with thoughts or reminders of the deceased. The depressed mood of an MDE is more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or preoccupations. The pain of grief may be accompanied by positive emotions and humor that are uncharacteristic of the pervasive unhappiness and misery characteristic of an MDE. The thought content associated with grief generally features a preoccupation with thoughts and memories of the deceased, rather than the self-critical or pessimistic ruminations seen in an MDE. In grief, self- esteem is generally preserved, whereas in an MDE, feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common. If self-derogatory ideation is present in grief, it typically involves perceived failings vis-à-vis the deceased (e.g., not visiting frequently enough, not telling the deceased how much he or she was loved). If a bereaved individual thinks about death and dying, such thoughts are gener- ally focused on the deceased and possibly about “joining” the deceased, whereas in an MDE, such thoughts are focused on ending one’s own life be- cause of feeling worthless, undeserving of life, or unable to cope with the pain of depression.",
