Persistent: Duration of period of nightmares is 6 months or greater. Specify current severity: Severity can be rated by the frequency with which the nightmares occur: Mild: Less than one episode per week on average. Moderate: One or more episodes per week but less than nightly. Severe: Episodes nightly. Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder 327.42 (G47.52) A. Repeated episodes of arousal during sleep associated with vo- calization and/or complex motor behaviors. B. These behaviors arise during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and therefore usually occur more than 90 minutes after sleep on- set, are more frequent during the later portions of the sleep pe- riod, and uncommonly occur during daytime naps. C. Upon awakening from these episodes, the individual is completely awake, alert, and not confused or disoriented. D. Either of the following: 1. REM sleep without atonia on polysomnographic recording. 2. A history suggestive of REM sleep behavior disorder and an established synucleinopathy diagnosis (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy). E. The behaviors cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (which may include injury to self or the bed partner). F. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition. G. Coexisting mental and medical disorders do not explain the epi- sodes. Restless Legs Syndrome 193 Restless Legs Syndrome 333.94 (G25.81) A. An urge to move the legs, usually accompanied by or in response to uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs, charac- terized by all of the following: 1. The urge to move the legs begins or worsens during periods of rest or inactivity. 2. The urge to move the legs is partially or totally relieved by movement. 3. The urge to move the legs is worse in the evening or at night than during the day, or occurs only in the evening or at night. B. The symptoms in Criterion A occur at least three times per week and have persisted for at least 3 months. C. The symptoms in Criterion A are accompanied by significant dis- tress or impairment in social, occupational, educational, aca- demic, behavioral, or other important areas of functioning. D. The symptoms in Criterion A are not attributable to another men- tal disorder or medical condition (e.g., arthritis, leg edema, pe- ripheral ischemia, leg cramps) and are not better explained by a behavioral condition (e.g., positional discomfort, habitual foot tapping). E. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a drug of abuse or medication (e.g., akathisia). Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder A. A prominent and severe disturbance in sleep. B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or lab- oratory findings of both (1) and (2): 1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxication or after withdrawal from or exposure to a medication. 2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in Criterion A.",
