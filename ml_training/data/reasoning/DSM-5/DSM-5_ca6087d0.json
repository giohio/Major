  "text": "274 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders Tobacco-Related Disorders Tobacco Use Disorder A. A problematic pattern of tobacco use leading to clinically signifi- cant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12-month period: 1. Tobacco is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer pe- riod than was intended. 2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control tobacco use. 3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain or use tobacco. 4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use tobacco. 5. Recurrent tobacco use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home (e.g., interference with work). 6. Continued tobacco use despite having persistent or recur- rent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of tobacco (e.g., arguments with others about tobacco use). 7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of tobacco use. 8. Recurrent tobacco use in situations in which it is physically hazardous (e.g., smoking in bed). 9. Tobacco use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by tobacco. 10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: a. A need for markedly increased amounts of tobacco to achieve the desired effect. b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of tobacco. Tobacco Use Disorder 275 11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: a. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for tobacco (refer to Criteria A and B of the criteria set for tobacco withdrawal). b. Tobacco (or a closely related substance, such as nico- tine) is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for tobacco use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for tobacco use disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use tobacco,” may be met). In sustained remission: After full criteria for tobacco use disor- der were previously met, none of the criteria for tobacco use dis- order have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use tobacco,” may be met). Specify if: On maintenance therapy: The individual is taking a long-term maintenance medication, such as nicotine replacement medica- tion, and no criteria for tobacco use disorder have been met for that class of medication (except tolerance to, or withdrawal from, the nicotine replacement medication). In a controlled environment: This additional specifier is used if the individual is in an environment where access to tobacco is re- stricted. Coding based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If a to- bacco withdrawal or tobacco-induced sleep disorder is also present, do not use the codes below for tobacco use disorder. Instead, the comor- bid tobacco use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the tobacco- induced disorder code (see the coding note for tobacco withdrawal or tobacco-induced sleep disorder). For example, if there is comorbid to- bacco-induced sleep disorder and tobacco use disorder, only the tobacco-induced sleep disorder code is given, with the 4th character in- dicating whether the comorbid tobacco use disorder is moderate or se- vere: F17.208 for moderate or severe tobacco use disorder with tobacco-induced sleep disorder. It is not permissible to code a comor- bid mild tobacco use disorder with a tobacco-induced sleep disorder.",
