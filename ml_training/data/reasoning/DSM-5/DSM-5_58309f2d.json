The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disor- der, including intoxication with another substance. Specify if: With perceptual disturbances: This specifier may be noted in the rare instance in which hallucinations with intact reality testing or auditory, visual, or tactile illusions occur in the absence of a delirium. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.89. The ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid opioid use disorder and whether or not there are perceptual disturbances. For opioid intoxication without perceptual disturbances: If a mild opioid use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F11.129, and if a moderate or severe opioid use disorder is co- morbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F11.229. If there is no comorbid opioid use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F11.929. For opioid intoxication with perceptual disturbances: If a mild opioid use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F11.122, and if a moderate or severe opioid use disorder is co- morbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F11.222. If there is no comorbid opioid use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F11.922. Opioid Withdrawal 292.0 (F11.23) A. Presence of either of the following: 1. Cessation of (or reduction in) opioid use that has been heavy and prolonged (i.e., several weeks or longer). 2. Administration of an opioid antagonist after a period of opioid use. B. Three (or more) of the following developing within minutes to several days after Criterion A: 1. Dysphoric mood. 2. Nausea or vomiting. 260 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders 3. Muscle aches. 4. Lacrimation or rhinorrhea. 5. Pupillary dilation, piloerection, or sweating. 6. Diarrhea. 7. Yawning. 8. Fever. 9. Insomnia. C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disor- der, including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.0. The ICD-10-CM code for opioid withdrawal is F11.23. Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates the comorbid presence of a moderate or severe opioid use disorder, reflecting the fact that opioid withdrawal can only occur in the pres- ence of a moderate or severe opioid use disorder. It is not permis- sible to code a comorbid mild opioid use disorder with opioid withdrawal. Other Opioid-Induced Disorders The following opioid-induced disorders are described in other chap- ters of the book with disorders with which they share phenomenol- ogy (see the substance/medication-induced mental disorders in these chapters): opioid-induced depressive disorder (“Depressive Dis- orders”); opioid-induced anxiety disorder (“Anxiety Disorders”); opi- oid-induced sleep disorder (“Sleep-Wake Disorders”); and opioid- induced sexual dysfunction (“Sexual Dysfunctions”). For opioid in- toxication delirium and opioid withdrawal delirium, see the criteria and discussion of delirium in the chapter “Neurocognitive Disor- ders.” These opioid-induced disorders are diagnosed instead of opi- oid intoxication or opioid withdrawal only when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention.",
