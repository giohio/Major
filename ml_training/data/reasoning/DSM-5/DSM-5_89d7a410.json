  "text": "This page intentionally left blank Feeding and Eating Disorders Pica A. Persistent eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances over a pe- riod of at least 1 month. B. The eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances is inappropriate to the developmental level of the individual. C. The eating behavior is not part of a culturally supported or socially normative practice. D. If the eating behavior occurs in the context of another mental disorder (e.g., intellectual disability [intellectual developmental disorder], autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia) or medical condition (including pregnancy), it is sufficiently severe to war- rant additional clinical attention. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code for pica is 307.52 and is used for children or adults. The ICD-10-CM codes for pica are (F98.3) in chil- dren and (F50.8) in adults. Specify if: In remission: After full criteria for pica were previously met, the criteria have not been met for a sustained period of time. Rumination Disorder 307.53 (F98.21) A. Repeated regurgitation of food over a period of at least 1 month. Regurgitated food may be re-chewed, re-swallowed, or spit out. B. The repeated regurgitation is not attributable to an associated gastrointestinal or other medical condition (e.g., gastroesopha- geal reflux, pyloric stenosis). 169 170 Feeding and Eating Disorders C. The eating disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disor- der, or avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. D. If the symptoms occur in the context of another mental disorder (e.g., intellectual disability [intellectual developmental disorder] or another neurodevelopmental disorder), they are sufficiently severe to warrant additional clinical attention. Specify if: In remission: After full criteria for rumination disorder were pre- viously met, the criteria have not been met for a sustained period of time. Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder 307.59 (F50.8) A. An eating or feeding disturbance (e.g., apparent lack of interest in eating or food; avoidance based on the sensory characteristics of food; concern about aversive consequences of eating) as mani- fested by persistent failure to meet appropriate nutritional and/or energy needs associated with one (or more) of the following: 1. Significant weight loss (or failure to achieve expected weight gain or faltering growth in children). 2. Significant nutritional deficiency. 3. Dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supple- ments. 4. Marked interference with psychosocial functioning. B. The disturbance is not better explained by lack of available food or by an associated culturally sanctioned practice. C. The eating disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, and there is no evidence of a disturbance in the way in which one’s body weight or shape is experienced. D. The eating disturbance is not attributable to a concurrent medical condition or not better explained by another mental disorder. When the eating disturbance occurs in the context of another Anorexia Nervosa 171 condition or disorder, the severity of the eating disturbance ex- ceeds that routinely associated with the condition or disorder and warrants additional clinical attention. Specify if: In remission: After full criteria for avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder were previously met, the criteria have not been met for a sustained period of time. Anorexia Nervosa A. Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements, leading to a significantly low body weight in the context of age, sex, devel- opmental trajectory, and physical health. Significantly low weight is defined as a weight that is less than minimally normal or, for chil- dren and adolescents, less than that minimally expected. B. Intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain, even though at a signif- icantly low weight. C. Disturbance in the way in which one’s body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self- evaluation, or persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of the current low body weight. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code for anorexia nervosa is 307.1, which is assigned regardless of the subtype. The ICD-10-CM code depends on the subtype (see below). Specify whether: (F50.01) Restricting type: During the last 3 months, the individ- ual has not engaged in recurrent episodes of binge eating or purging behavior (i.e., self-induced vomiting or the misuse of lax- atives, diuretics, or enemas). This subtype describes presenta- tions in which weight loss is accomplished primarily through dieting, fasting, and/or excessive exercise. (F50.02) Binge-eating/purging type: During the last 3 months, the individual has engaged in recurrent episodes of binge eating or purging behavior (i.e., self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas). 172 Feeding and Eating Disorders Specify if: In partial remission: After full criteria for anorexia nervosa were previously met, Criterion A (low body weight) has not been met for a sustained period, but either Criterion B (intense fear of gain- ing weight or becoming fat or behavior that interferes with weight gain) or Criterion C (disturbances in self-perception of weight and shape) is still met. In full remission: After full criteria for anorexia nervosa were previously met, none of the criteria have been met for a sus- tained period of time. Specify current severity: The minimum level of severity is based, for adults, on current body mass index (BMI) (see below) or, for children and adolescents, on BMI percentile. The ranges below are derived from World Health Or- ganization categories for thinness in adults; for children and adoles- cents, corresponding BMI percentiles should be used. The level of severity may be increased to reflect clinical symptoms, the degree of functional disability, and the need for supervision. Mild: BMI ≥ 17 kg/m2 Moderate: BMI 16–16.99 kg/m2 Severe: BMI 15–15.99 kg/m2 Extreme: BMI < 15 kg/m2 Bulimia Nervosa 307.51 (F50.2) A. Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized by both of the following: 1. Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than what most individuals would eat in a similar period of time under similar circumstances. 2. A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g., a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating).",
