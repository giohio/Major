  "text": "Stimulant Use Disorder 269 In sustained remission: After full criteria for stimulant use dis- order were previously met, none of the criteria for stimulant use disorder have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the stimulant,” may be met). Specify if: In a controlled environment: This additional specifier is used if the individual is in an environment where access to stimulants is restricted. Coding based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If an amphetamine intoxication, amphetamine withdrawal, or another am- phetamine-induced mental disorder is also present, do not use the codes below for amphetamine use disorder. Instead, the comorbid amphetamine use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the am- phetamine-induced disorder code (see the coding note for amphet- amine intoxication, amphetamine withdrawal, or a specific amphet- amine-induced mental disorder). For example, if there is comorbid amphetamine-type or other stimulant-induced depressive disorder and amphetamine-type or other stimulant use disorder, only the amphet- amine-type or other stimulant-induced depressive disorder code is given, with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid amphet- amine-type or other stimulant use disorder is mild, moderate, or se- vere: F15.14 for mild amphetamine-type or other stimulant use disor- der with amphetamine-type or other stimulant-induced depressive disorder or F15.24 for a moderate or severe amphetamine-type or other stimulant use disorder with amphetamine-type or other stimu- lant-induced depressive disorder. Similarly, if there is comorbid co- caine-induced depressive disorder and cocaine use disorder, only the cocaine-induced depressive disorder code is given, with the 4th char- acter indicating whether the comorbid cocaine use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe: F14.14 for mild cocaine use disorder with co- caine-induced depressive disorder or F14.24 for a moderate or severe cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced depressive disorder. Specify current severity: Mild: Presence of 2–3 symptoms 305.70 (F15.10) Amphetamine-type substance 305.60 (F14.10) Cocaine 305.70 (F15.10) Other or unspecified stimulant 270 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders Moderate: Presence of 4–5 symptoms 304.40 (F15.20) Amphetamine-type substance 304.20 (F14.20) Cocaine 304.40 (F15.20) Other or unspecified stimulant Severe: Presence of 6 or more symptoms 304.40 (F15.20) Amphetamine-type substance 304.20 (F14.20) Cocaine 304.40 (F15.20) Other or unspecified stimulant Stimulant Intoxication A. Recent use of an amphetamine-type substance, cocaine, or other stimulant. B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., euphoria or affective blunting; changes in socia- bility; hypervigilance; interpersonal sensitivity; anxiety, tension, or anger; stereotyped behaviors; impaired judgment) that devel- oped during, or shortly after, use of a stimulant. C. Two (or more) of the following signs or symptoms, developing during, or shortly after, stimulant use: 1. Tachycardia or bradycardia. 2. Pupillary dilation. 3. Elevated or lowered blood pressure. 4. Perspiration or chills. 5. Nausea or vomiting. 6. Evidence of weight loss. 7. Psychomotor agitation or retardation. 8. Muscular weakness, respiratory depression, chest pain, or cardiac arrhythmias. 9. Confusion, seizures, dyskinesias, dystonias, or coma. D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disor- der, including intoxication with another substance. Stimulant Intoxication 271 Specify the specific intoxicant (i.e., amphetamine-type substance, cocaine, or other stimulant). Specify if: With perceptual disturbances: This specifier may be noted when hallucinations with intact reality testing or auditory, visual, or tactile illusions occur in the absence of a delirium. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.89. The ICD-10-CM code depends on whether the stimulant is an amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant; whether there is a comorbid amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant use disorder; and whether or not there are percep- tual disturbances. For amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant intoxication, without perceptual disturbances: If a mild amphetamine or other stimulant use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F15.129, and if a moderate or severe amphetamine or other stimulant use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F15.229. If there is no comorbid amphetamine or other stimulant use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F15.929. Similarly, if a mild cocaine use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F14.129, and if a moderate or severe cocaine use disorder is co- morbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F14.229. If there is no comorbid cocaine use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F14.929. For amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant intoxication, with perceptual disturbances: If a mild amphetamine or other stimulant use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F15.122, and if a moderate or severe amphetamine or other stimulant use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F15.222. If there is no comorbid amphetamine or other stimulant use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F15.922. Similarly, if a mild cocaine use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F14.122, and if a moderate or severe cocaine use disorder is co- morbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F14.222. If there is no comorbid cocaine use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F14.922.",
