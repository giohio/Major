  "text": "184 Sleep-Wake Disorders Narcolepsy A. Recurrent periods of an irrepressible need to sleep, lapsing into sleep, or napping occurring within the same day. These must have been occurring at least three times per week over the past 3 months. B. The presence of at least one of the following: 1. Episodes of cataplexy, defined as either (a) or (b), occurring at least a few times per month: a. In individuals with long-standing disease, brief (seconds to minutes) episodes of sudden bilateral loss of muscle tone with maintained consciousness that are precipi- tated by laughter or joking. b. In children or in individuals within 6 months of onset, spontaneous grimaces or jaw-opening episodes with tongue thrusting or a global hypotonia, without any obvi- ous emotional triggers. 2. Hypocretin deficiency, as measured using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin-1 immunoreactivity values (less than or equal to one-third of values obtained in healthy subjects tested using the same assay, or less than or equal to 110 pg/ mL). Low CSF levels of hypocretin-1 must not be observed in the context of acute brain injury, inflammation, or infection. 3. Nocturnal sleep polysomnography showing rapid eye move- ment (REM) sleep latency less than or equal to 15 minutes, or a multiple sleep latency test showing a mean sleep latency less than or equal to 8 minutes and two or more sleep-onset REM periods. Specify whether: 347.00 (G47.419) Narcolepsy without cataplexy but with hypo- cretin deficiency: Criterion B requirements of low CSF hypocre- tin-1 levels and positive polysomnography/multiple sleep latency test are met, but no cataplexy is present (Criterion B1 not met). Narcolepsy 185 347.01 (G47.411) Narcolepsy with cataplexy but without hypocretin deficiency: In this rare subtype (less than 5% of nar- colepsy cases), Criterion B requirements of cataplexy and posi- tive polysomnography/multiple sleep latency test are met, but CSF hypocretin-1 levels are normal (Criterion B2 not met). 347.00 (G47.419) Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, deafness, and narcolepsy: This subtype is caused by exon 21 DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase-1 mutations and is charac- terized by late-onset (age 30–40 years) narcolepsy (with low or intermediate CSF hypocretin-1 levels), deafness, cerebellar ataxia, and eventually dementia. 347.00 (G47.419) Autosomal dominant narcolepsy, obesity, and type 2 diabetes: Narcolepsy, obesity, and type 2 diabetes and low CSF hypocretin-1 levels have been described in rare cases and are associated with a mutation in the myelin oligoden- drocyte glycoprotein gene. 347.10 (G47.429) Narcolepsy secondary to another medical condition: This subtype is for narcolepsy that develops second- ary to medical conditions that cause infectious (e.g., Whipple’s disease, sarcoidosis), traumatic, or tumoral destruction of hypo- cretin neurons. Coding note (for ICD-9-CM code 347.10 only): Code first the underlying medical condition (e.g., 040.2 Whipple’s dis- ease; 347.10 narcolepsy secondary to Whipple’s disease). Specify current severity: Mild: Infrequent cataplexy (less than once per week), need for naps only once or twice per day, and less disturbed nocturnal sleep. Moderate: Cataplexy once daily or every few days, disturbed nocturnal sleep, and need for multiple naps daily. Severe: Drug-resistant cataplexy with multiple attacks daily, nearly constant sleepiness, and disturbed nocturnal sleep (i.e., movements, insomnia, and vivid dreaming).",
