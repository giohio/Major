  "text": "246 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders Specify if: In a controlled environment: This additional specifier is used if the individual is in an environment where access to phencycli- dines is restricted. Coding based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If a phencyclidine intoxication or another phencyclidine-induced mental dis- order is also present, do not use the codes below for phencyclidine use disorder. Instead, the comorbid phencyclidine use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the phencyclidine-induced disorder code (see the coding note for phencyclidine intoxication or a specific phencyclidine- induced mental disorder). For example, if there is comorbid phencycli- dine-induced psychotic disorder, only the phencyclidine-induced psy- chotic disorder code is given, with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid phencyclidine use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe: F16.159 for mild phencyclidine use disorder with phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder or F16.259 for a moderate or severe phencyclidine use disorder with phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder. Specify current severity: 305.90 (F16.10) Mild: Presence of 2–3 symptoms 304.60 (F16.20) Moderate: Presence of 4–5 symptoms 304.60 (F16.20) Severe: Presence of 6 or more symptoms Other Hallucinogen Use Disorder A. A problematic pattern of hallucinogen (other than phencyclidine) use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12- month period: 1. The hallucinogen is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended. 2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control hallucinogen use. 3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the hallucinogen, use the hallucinogen, or recover from its effects. 4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the hallucinogen. Other Hallucinogen Use Disorder 247 5. Recurrent hallucinogen use resulting in a failure to fulfill ma- jor role obligations at work, school, or home (e.g., repeated absences from work or poor work performance related to hallucinogen use; hallucinogen-related absences, suspen- sions, or expulsions from school; neglect of children or household). 6. Continued hallucinogen use despite having persistent or re- current social or interpersonal problems caused or exacer- bated by the effects of the hallucinogen (e.g., arguments with a spouse about consequences of intoxication; physical fights). 7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of hallucinogen use. 8. Recurrent hallucinogen use in situations in which it is physi- cally hazardous (e.g., driving an automobile or operating a machine when impaired by the hallucinogen). 9. Hallucinogen use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by the hal- lucinogen. 10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: a. A need for markedly increased amounts of the hallucino- gen to achieve intoxication or desired effect. b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the hallucinogen. Note: Withdrawal symptoms and signs are not established for hallucinogens, and so this criterion does not apply. Specify the particular hallucinogen. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for other hallucinogen use dis- order were previously met, none of the criteria for other hallucino- gen use disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the hallucinogen,” may be met). In sustained remission: After full criteria for other hallucinogen use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for other hallucinogen use disorder have been met at any time during a 248 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the hallucinogen,” may be met). Specify if: In a controlled environment: This additional specifier is used if the individual is in an environment where access to hallucino- gens is restricted. Coding based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If a hallucinogen intoxication or another hallucinogen-induced mental disorder is also present, do not use the codes below for hallucinogen use disorder. Instead, the comorbid hallucinogen use disorder is in- dicated in the 4th character of the hallucinogen-induced disorder code (see the coding note for hallucinogen intoxication or a specific hallucinogen-induced mental disorder). For example, if there is co- morbid hallucinogen-induced psychotic disorder and hallucinogen use disorder, only the hallucinogen-induced psychotic disorder code is given, with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid hal- lucinogen use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe: F16.159 for mild hallucinogen use disorder with hallucinogen-induced psychotic disor- der or F16.259 for a moderate or severe hallucinogen use disorder with hallucinogen-induced psychotic disorder. Specify current severity: 305.30 (F16.10) Mild: Presence of 2–3 symptoms 304.50 (F16.20) Moderate: Presence of 4–5 symptoms 304.50 (F16.20) Severe: Presence of 6 or more symptoms Phencyclidine Intoxication A. Recent use of phencyclidine (or a pharmacologically similar sub- stance). B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral changes (e.g., bellig- erence, assaultiveness, impulsiveness, unpredictability, psycho- motor agitation, impaired judgment) that developed during, or shortly after, phencyclidine use. C. Within 1 hour, two (or more) of the following signs or symptoms: Other Hallucinogen Intoxication 249 Note: When the drug is smoked, “snorted,” or used intravenously, the onset may be particularly rapid. 1. Vertical or horizontal nystagmus. 2. Hypertension or tachycardia. 3. Numbness or diminished responsiveness to pain. 4. Ataxia. 5. Dysarthria. 6. Muscle rigidity. 7. Seizures or coma. 8. Hyperacusis. D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disor- der, including intoxication with another substance. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.89. The ICD-10-CM code de- pends on whether there is a comorbid phencyclidine use disorder. If a mild phencyclidine use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F16.129, and if a moderate or severe phencyclidine use disorder is co- morbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F16.229. If there is no comorbid phen- cyclidine use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F16.929. Other Hallucinogen Intoxication A. Recent use of a hallucinogen (other than phencyclidine). B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., marked anxiety or depression, ideas of reference, fear of “losing one’s mind,” paranoid ideation, impaired judg- ment) that developed during, or shortly after, hallucinogen use. C. Perceptual changes occurring in a state of full wakefulness and alertness (e.g., subjective intensification of perceptions, deper- sonalization, derealization, illusions, hallucinations, synesthe- sias) that developed during, or shortly after, hallucinogen use. D. Two (or more) of the following signs developing during, or shortly after, hallucinogen use: 1. Pupillary dilation. 2. Tachycardia.",
