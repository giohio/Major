Obsessions, compulsions, skin picking, hair pulling, other body- focused repetitive behaviors, or other symptoms characteristic of the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders predominate in the clinical picture. B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or lab- oratory findings of both (1) and (2): 1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication. 2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in Criterion A. C. The disturbance is not better explained by an obsessive-compul- sive and related disorder that is not substance/medication- induced. Such evidence of an independent obsessive-compul- sive and related disorder could include the following: The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medica- tion use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute with- drawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence sug- gesting the existence of an independent non-substance/ medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related dis- order (e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance/medication- related episodes). D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Note: This diagnosis should be made in addition to a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symp- toms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and are suffi- ciently severe to warrant clinical attention. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medication]-induced obsessive-compulsive and related Substance/Medication-Induced OCRD 135 disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced obsessive- compulsive and related disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced obsessive-compul- sive and related disorder”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced obsessive-compul- sive and related disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the cli- nician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disor- der (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the sub- stance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder. ICD-10-CM With use With use disorder, ICD-9- disorder, moderate Without use CM mild or severe disorder Amphetamine 292.89 F15.188 F15.288 F15.988 (or other stimulant) Cocaine 292.89 F14.188 F14.288 F14.988 Other (or unknown) 292.89 F19.188 F19.288 F19.988 substance Specify if (see Table 1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addic- tive Disorders” for diagnoses associated with substance class): With onset during intoxication: If the criteria are met for intox- ication with the substance and the symptoms develop during in- toxication. 136 Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders With onset during withdrawal: If criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal. With onset after medication use: Symptoms may appear either at initiation of medication or after a modification or change in use. Recording Procedures ICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced obses- sive-compulsive and related disorder begins with the specific sub- stance (e.g., cocaine) that is presumed to be causing the obsessive- compulsive and related symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes, the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a sub- stance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used. The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset after medication use). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10- CM, which combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of repetitive behaviors occurring during intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.89 cocaine-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, with onset during intox- ication. An additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe cocaine use disorder is also given. When more than one substance is judged to play a sig- nificant role in the development of the obsessive-compulsive and re- lated disorder, each should be listed separately. ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced ob- sessive-compulsive and related disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine) that is presumed to be causing the obses- sive-compulsive and related symptoms. The diagnostic code is se- lected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes, the OCRD Due to Another Medical Condition 137 code for “other substance” with no comorbid substance use should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiolog- ical factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the cate- gory “unknown substance” with no comorbid substance use should be used. When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid sub- stance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word “with,” followed by the name of the substance-induced obsessive-compul- sive and related disorder, followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset after medication use). For example, in the case of repetitive behaviors oc- curring during intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine use dis- order, the diagnosis is F14.288 severe cocaine use disorder with co- caine-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, with onset during intoxication. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid se- vere cocaine use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced ob- sessive-compulsive and related disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the sub- stance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F15.988 amphetamine-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, with onset during intoxication). When more than one sub- stance is judged to play a significant role in the development of the obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, each should be listed separately. Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition 294.8 (F06.8) A. Obsessions, compulsions, preoccupations with appearance, hoarding, skin picking, hair pulling, other body-focused repetitive behaviors, or other symptoms characteristic of obsessive-com- pulsive and related disorder predominate in the clinical picture. B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or lab- oratory findings that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiolog- ical consequence of another medical condition. C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder.",
