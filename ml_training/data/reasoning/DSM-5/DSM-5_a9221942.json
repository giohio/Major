Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors in order to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications; fasting; or excessive exercise. C. The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors both occur, on average, at least once a week for 3 months. D. Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight. E. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa. Specify if: In partial remission: After full criteria for bulimia nervosa were previously met, some, but not all, of the criteria have been met for a sustained period of time. In full remission: After full criteria for bulimia nervosa were pre- viously met, none of the criteria have been met for a sustained period of time. Specify current severity: The minimum level of severity is based on the frequency of inappro- priate compensatory behaviors (see below). The level of severity may be increased to reflect other symptoms and the degree of func- tional disability. Mild: An average of 1–3 episodes of inappropriate compensa- tory behaviors per week. Moderate: An average of 4–7 episodes of inappropriate com- pensatory behaviors per week. Severe: An average of 8–13 episodes of inappropriate compen- satory behaviors per week. Extreme: An average of 14 or more episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors per week. 174 Feeding and Eating Disorders Binge-Eating Disorder 307.51 (F50.8) A. Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized by both of the following: 1. Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than what most people would eat in a similar period of time under sim- ilar circumstances. 2. A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g., a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating). B. The binge-eating episodes are associated with three (or more) of the following: 1. Eating much more rapidly than normal. 2. Eating until feeling uncomfortably full. 3. Eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry. 4. Eating alone because of feeling embarrassed by how much one is eating. 5. Feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed, or very guilty af- terward. C. Marked distress regarding binge eating is present. D. The binge eating occurs, on average, at least once a week for 3 months. E. The binge eating is not associated with the recurrent use of inap- propriate compensatory behavior as in bulimia nervosa and does not occur exclusively during the course of bulimia nervosa or an- orexia nervosa. Specify if: In partial remission: After full criteria for binge-eating disorder were previously met, binge eating occurs at an average frequency of less than one episode per week for a sustained period of time.",
