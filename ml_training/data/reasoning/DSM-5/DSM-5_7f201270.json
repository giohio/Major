Koro: Related to dhat syndrome (see “Glossary of Cultural Con- cepts of Distress” in the Appendix to DSM-5), an episode of sud- den and intense anxiety that the penis (or the vulva and nipples in females) will recede into the body, possibly leading to death. 7. Jikoshu-kyofu: A variant of taijin kyofusho (see “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress” in the Appendix to DSM-5) char- acterized by fear of having an offensive body odor (also termed olfactory reference syndrome). Unspecified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder 300.3 (F42) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character- istic of an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder that cause clin- ically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the obsessive-compulsive and relat- ed disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder category is used in situations in which the clini- cian chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings). Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders Reactive Attachment Disorder 313.89 (F94.1) A. A consistent pattern of inhibited, emotionally withdrawn behavior toward adult caregivers, manifested by both of the following: 1. The child rarely or minimally seeks comfort when distressed. 2. The child rarely or minimally responds to comfort when dis- tressed. B. A persistent social and emotional disturbance characterized by at least two of the following: 1. Minimal social and emotional responsiveness to others. 2. Limited positive affect. 3. Episodes of unexplained irritability, sadness, or fearfulness that are evident even during nonthreatening interactions with adult caregivers. C. The child has experienced a pattern of extremes of insufficient care as evidenced by at least one of the following: 1. Social neglect or deprivation in the form of persistent lack of having basic emotional needs for comfort, stimulation, and affection met by caregiving adults. 2. Repeated changes of primary caregivers that limit opportuni- ties to form stable attachments (e.g., frequent changes in foster care). 3. Rearing in unusual settings that severely limit opportunities to form selective attachments (e.g., institutions with high child-to-caregiver ratios). D. The care in Criterion C is presumed to be responsible for the dis- turbed behavior in Criterion A (e.g., the disturbances in Criterion A began following the lack of adequate care in Criterion C). 141 142 Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders E. The criteria are not met for autism spectrum disorder. F. The disturbance is evident before age 5 years. G. The child has a developmental age of at least 9 months. Specify if: Persistent: The disorder has been present for more than 12 months. Specify current severity: Reactive attachment disorder is specified as severe when a child exhibits all symptoms of the disorder, with each symptom manifesting at relatively high levels. Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder 313.89 (F94.2) A. A pattern of behavior in which a child actively approaches and inter- acts with unfamiliar adults and exhibits at least two of the following: 1. Reduced or absent reticence in approaching and interacting with unfamiliar adults. 2. Overly familiar verbal or physical behavior (that is not consis- tent with culturally sanctioned and with age-appropriate so- cial boundaries). 3. Diminished or absent checking back with adult caregiver af- ter venturing away, even in unfamiliar settings. 4. Willingness to go off with an unfamiliar adult with minimal or no hesitation. B. The behaviors in Criterion A are not limited to impulsivity (as in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) but include socially disin- hibited behavior. C. The child has experienced a pattern of extremes of insufficient care as evidenced by at least one of the following: 1. Social neglect or deprivation in the form of persistent lack of having basic emotional needs for comfort, stimulation, and affection met by caregiving adults. 2. Repeated changes of primary caregivers that limit oppor- tunities to form stable attachments (e.g., frequent changes in foster care).",
