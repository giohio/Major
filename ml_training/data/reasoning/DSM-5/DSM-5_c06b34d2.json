  "text": "Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder 101 E. The disturbance is not merely an exacerbation of the symptoms of another disorder, such as major depressive disorder, panic disor- der, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), or a personality dis- order (although it may co-occur with any of these disorders). F. Criterion A should be confirmed by prospective daily ratings dur- ing at least two symptomatic cycles. (Note: The diagnosis may be made provisionally prior to this confirmation.) G. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treat- ment) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism). Recording Procedures If symptoms have not been confirmed by prospective daily ratings of at least two symptomatic cycles, “provisional” should be noted after the name of the diagnosis (i.e., “premenstrual dysphoric disorder, provisional”). Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder A. A prominent and persistent disturbance in mood that predomi- nates in the clinical picture and is characterized by depressed mood or markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities. B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or lab- oratory findings of both (1) and (2): 1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication. 2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in Criterion A. C. The disturbance is not better explained by a depressive disorder that is not substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent depressive disorder could include the following: The symptoms preceded the onset of the substance/medica- tion use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of 102 Depressive Disorders time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute with- drawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence sug- gesting the existence of an independent non-substance/ medication-induced depressive disorder (e.g., a history of re- current non-substance/medication-related episodes). D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Note: This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of sub- stance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and when they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medication]-induced depressive disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comor- bid with the substance-induced depressive disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced depressive disorder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced depressive disor- der”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced depressive disorder, the 4th position charac- ter is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the se- verity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the sub- stance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the substance-induced depressive disorder.

With onset during withdrawal: If criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal. Recording Procedures ICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced de- pressive disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the depressive symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in 104 Depressive Disorders the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used. The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the substance- induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single code, for ICD- 9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of depressive symptoms occurring during with- drawal in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.84 cocaine-induced depressive disorder, with onset during with- drawal. An additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe cocaine use disorder is also given. When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of depressive mood symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., 292.84 methylphenidate-induced depressive dis- order, with onset during withdrawal; 292.84 dexamethasone-induced depressive disorder, with onset during intoxication). ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced de- pressive disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the depressive symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or ab- sence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used. When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid sub- stance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word “with,” followed by the name of the substance-induced depressive disorder, followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal). For example, in the case of depressive symp- toms occurring during withdrawal in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is F14.24 severe cocaine use disorder with co- caine-induced depressive disorder, with onset during withdrawal. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe cocaine use disorder is not Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition 105 given. If the substance-induced depressive disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F16.94 phencyclidine-induced depressive disorder, with onset during intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a sig- nificant role in the development of depressive mood symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., F15.24 severe methylphenidate use disorder with methylphenidate-induced depressive disorder, with onset during withdrawal; F19.94 dexamethasone-induced depressive disorder, with onset during intoxication). Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition A. A prominent and persistent period of depressed mood or mark- edly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities that predominates in the clinical picture. B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or lab- oratory findings that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiolog- ical consequence of another medical condition. C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disor- der (e.g., adjustment disorder, with depressed mood, in which the stressor is a serious medical condition). D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code for depressive disorder due to an- other medical condition is 293.83, which is assigned regardless of the specifier. The ICD-10-CM code depends on the specifier (see below). Specify if: (F06.31) With depressive features: Full criteria are not met for a major depressive episode. (F06.32) With major depressive–like episode: Full criteria are met (except Criterion C) for a major depressive episode. (F06.34) With mixed features: Symptoms of mania or hypoma- nia are also present but do not predominate in the clinical picture.",
