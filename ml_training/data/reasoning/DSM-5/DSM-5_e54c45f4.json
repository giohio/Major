The other specified delirium category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for delirium or any specific neurocognitive disorder. This is done by recording “other specified delirium” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “attenuated delirium syndrome”). An example of a presentation that can be specified using the “other specified” designation is the following: Attenuated delirium syndrome: This syndrome applies in cases of delirium in which the severity of cognitive impairment falls short of that required for the diagnosis, or in which some, but not all, di- agnostic criteria for delirium are met. Unspecified Delirium 780.09 (R41.0) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character- istic of delirium that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predom- inate but do not meet the full criteria for delirium or any of the disorders in the neurocognitive disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified delir- ium category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for delirium, and in- cludes presentations for which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings). Major Neurocognitive Disorder 299 Major and Mild Neurocognitive Disorders Major Neurocognitive Disorder A. Evidence of significant cognitive decline from a previous level of performance in one or more cognitive domains (complex atten- tion, executive function, learning and memory, language, per- ceptual-motor, or social cognition) based on: 1. Concern of the individual, a knowledgeable informant, or the clinician that there has been a significant decline in cognitive function; and 2. A substantial impairment in cognitive performance, prefera- bly documented by standardized neuropsychological testing or, in its absence, another quantified clinical assessment. B. The cognitive deficits interfere with independence in everyday activities (i.e., at a minimum, requiring assistance with complex instrumental activities of daily living such as paying bills or man- aging medications). C. The cognitive deficits do not occur exclusively in the context of a delirium. D. The cognitive deficits are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder, schizophrenia). Specify whether due to: Alzheimer’s disease (pp. 305–306) Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (pp. 306–308) Lewy body disease (pp. 308–309) Vascular disease (pp. 309–310) Traumatic brain injury (pp. 310–311) Substance/medication use (pp. 311–315) HIV infection (pp. 315–316) Prion disease (p. 316) Parkinson’s disease (pp. 316–317) Huntington’s disease (pp. 317–318) 300 Neurocognitive Disorders Another medical condition (pp. 318–319) Multiple etiologies (pp. 319–320) Unspecified (p. 320) Coding note: Code based on medical or substance etiology. In some cases, there is need for an additional code for the etiological medical condition, which must immediately precede the diagnostic code for major neurocognitive disorder, as shown in table on pp. 302–304. Specify: Without behavioral disturbance: If the cognitive disturbance is not accompanied by any clinically significant behavioral distur- bance. With behavioral disturbance (specify disturbance): If the cog- nitive disturbance is accompanied by a clinically significant behavioral disturbance (e.g., psychotic symptoms, mood distur- bance, agitation, apathy, or other behavioral symptoms). Specify current severity: Mild: Difficulties with instrumental activities of daily living (e.g., housework, managing money). Moderate: Difficulties with basic activities of daily living (e.g., feeding, dressing). Severe: Fully dependent. Mild Neurocognitive Disorder A. Evidence of modest cognitive decline from a previous level of performance in one or more cognitive domains (complex atten- tion, executive function, learning and memory, language, per- ceptual-motor, or social cognition) based on: 1. Concern of the individual, a knowledgeable informant, or the clinician that there has been a mild decline in cognitive func- tion; and 2. A modest impairment in cognitive performance, preferably documented by standardized neuropsychological testing or, in its absence, another quantified clinical assessment. B. The cognitive deficits do not interfere with capacity for indepen- dence in everyday activities (i.e., complex instrumental activities Mild Neurocognitive Disorder 301 of daily living such as paying bills or managing medications are preserved, but greater effort, compensatory strategies, or accom- modation may be required). C. The cognitive deficits do not occur exclusively in the context of a delirium. D. The cognitive deficits are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder, schizophrenia). Specify whether due to: Alzheimer’s disease (pp. 305–306) Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (pp. 306–308) Lewy body disease (pp. 308–309) Vascular disease (pp. 309–310) Traumatic brain injury (pp. 310–311) Substance/medication use (pp. 311–315) HIV infection (pp. 315–316) Prion disease (p. 316) Parkinson’s disease (pp. 316–317) Huntington’s disease (pp. 317–318) Another medical condition (pp. 318–319) Multiple etiologies (pp. 319–320) Unspecified (p. 320) Coding note: For mild neurocognitive disorder due to any of the medical etiologies listed above, code 331.83 (G31.84). Do not use additional codes for the presumed etiological medical conditions. For substance/medication-induced mild neurocognitive disorder, code based on type of substance; see “Substance/Medication-Induced Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder.” For unspecified mild neuro- cognitive disorder, code 799.59 (R41.9). Specify: Without behavioral disturbance: If the cognitive disturbance is not accompanied by any clinically significant behavioral distur- bance. With behavioral disturbance (specify disturbance): If the cog- nitive disturbance is accompanied by a clinically significant behavioral disturbance (e.g., psychotic symptoms, mood distur- bance, agitation, apathy, or other behavioral symptoms).",
