Anxiety. 8. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures. C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disor- der, including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance. Specify if: With perceptual disturbances: This specifier applies in the rare instance when hallucinations (usually visual or tactile) occur with intact reality testing, or auditory, visual, or tactile illusions occur in the absence of a delirium. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 291.81. The ICD-10-CM code for alcohol withdrawal without perceptual disturbances is F10.239, and the ICD-10-CM code for alcohol withdrawal with perceptual dis- turbances is F10.232. Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates the comorbid presence of a moderate or severe alcohol use disorder, reflecting the fact that alcohol withdrawal can only occur in the presence of a moderate or severe alcohol use disorder. It is not per- missible to code a comorbid mild alcohol use disorder with alcohol withdrawal. Other Alcohol-Induced Disorders The following alcohol-induced disorders are described in other chap- ters of the book with disorders with which they share phenomenol- ogy (see the substance/medication-induced mental disorders in these chapters): alcohol-induced psychotic disorder (“Schizophrenia Spec- trum and Other Psychotic Disorders”); alcohol-induced bipolar dis- order (“Bipolar and Related Disorders”); alcohol-induced depressive Unspecified Alcohol-Related Disorder 237 disorder (“Depressive Disorders”); alcohol-induced anxiety disorder (“Anxiety Disorders”); alcohol-induced sleep disorder (“Sleep-Wake Disorders”); alcohol-induced sexual dysfunction (“Sexual Dysfunc- tions”); and alcohol-induced major or mild neurocognitive disorder (“Neurocognitive Disorders”). For alcohol intoxication delirium and alcohol withdrawal delirium, see the criteria and discussion of delir- ium in the chapter “Neurocognitive Disorders.” These alcohol- induced disorders are diagnosed instead of alcohol intoxication or al- cohol withdrawal only when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention. Unspecified Alcohol-Related Disorder 291.9 (F10.99) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character- istic of an alcohol-related disorder that cause clinically significant dis- tress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any specific alcohol-related disorder or any of the disorders in the sub- stance-related and addictive disorders diagnostic class. Caffeine-Related Disorders Caffeine Intoxication 305.90 (F15.929) A. Recent consumption of caffeine (typically a high dose well in ex- cess of 250 mg). B. Five (or more) of the following signs or symptoms developing during, or shortly after, caffeine use: 1. Restlessness. 2. Nervousness. 238 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders 3. Excitement. 4. Insomnia. 5. Flushed face. 6. Diuresis. 7. Gastrointestinal disturbance. 8. Muscle twitching. 9. Rambling flow of thought and speech. 10. Tachycardia or cardiac arrhythmia. 11. Periods of inexhaustibility. 12. Psychomotor agitation. C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disor- der, including intoxication with another substance. Caffeine Withdrawal 292.0 (F15.93) A. Prolonged daily use of caffeine. B. Abrupt cessation of or reduction in caffeine use, followed within 24 hours by three (or more) of the following signs or symptoms: 1. Headache. 2. Marked fatigue or drowsiness. 3. Dysphoric mood, depressed mood, or irritability. 4. Difficulty concentrating. 5. Flu-like symptoms (nausea, vomiting, or muscle pain/stiff- ness). C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The signs or symptoms are not associated with the physiological effects of another medical condition (e.g., migraine, viral illness) Unspecified Caffeine-Related Disorder 239 and are not better explained by another mental disorder, includ- ing intoxication or withdrawal from another substance. Other Caffeine-Induced Disorders The following caffeine-induced disorders are described in other chap- ters of the book with disorders with which they share phenomenol- ogy (see the substance/medication-induced mental disorders in these chapters): caffeine-induced anxiety disorder (“Anxiety Disorders”) and caffeine-induced sleep disorder (“Sleep-Wake Disorders”). These caffeine-induced disorders are diagnosed instead of caffeine intoxica- tion or caffeine withdrawal only when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention. Unspecified Caffeine-Related Disorder 292.9 (F15.99) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character- istic of a caffeine-related disorder that cause clinically significant dis- tress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any specific caffeine-related disorder or any of the disorders in the sub- stance-related and addictive disorders diagnostic class. Cannabis-Related Disorders Cannabis Use Disorder A. A problematic pattern of cannabis use leading to clinically signif- icant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12-month period: 240 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders 1. Cannabis is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended. 2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control cannabis use. 3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to ob- tain cannabis, use cannabis, or recover from its effects. 4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use cannabis. 5. Recurrent cannabis use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home. 6. Continued cannabis use despite having persistent or re- current social or interpersonal problems caused or exac- erbated by the effects of cannabis. 7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of cannabis use. 8. Recurrent cannabis use in situations in which it is physi- cally hazardous. 9. Cannabis use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by cannabis. 10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: a. A need for markedly increased amounts of cannabis to achieve intoxication or desired effect. b. Markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of cannabis. 11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: a. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for cannabis (refer to Criteria A and B of the criteria set for cannabis withdrawal, pp. 242–243). b. Cannabis (or a closely related substance) is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for cannabis use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for cannabis use disor- der have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use cannabis,” may be met).",
