Unspecified Tobacco-Related Disorder 292.9 (F17.209) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character- istic of a tobacco-related disorder that cause clinically significant dis- tress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any specific tobacco-related disorder or any of the disorders in the sub- stance-related and addictive disorders diagnostic class. Other (or Unknown) Substance–Related Disorders Other (or Unknown) Substance Use Disorder A. A problematic pattern of use of an intoxicating substance not able to be classified within the alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; hallucino- gen (phencyclidine and others); inhalant; opioid; sedative, hyp- notic, or anxiolytic; stimulant; or tobacco categories and leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12-month period: 1. The substance is often taken in larger amounts or over a lon- ger period than was intended. 278 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders 2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control use of the substance. 3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the substance, use the substance, or recover from its effects. 4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the substance. 5. Recurrent use of the substance resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home. 6. Continued use of the substance despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacer- bated by the effects of its use. 7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of use of the substance. 8. Recurrent use of the substance in situations in which it is physically hazardous. 9. Use of the substance is continued despite knowledge of hav- ing a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological prob- lem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by the substance. 10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: a. A need for markedly increased amounts of the sub- stance to achieve intoxication or desired effect. b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the substance. 11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: a. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for other (or un- known) substance (refer to Criteria A and B of the criteria sets for other [or unknown] substance withdrawal, pp. 280–281). b. The substance (or a closely related substance) is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for other (or unknown) sub- stance use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for other (or unknown) substance use disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with the exception Other (or Unknown) Substance Use Disorder 279 that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the substance,” may be met). In sustained remission: After full criteria for other (or unknown) substance use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for other (or unknown) substance use disorder have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or longer (with the excep- tion that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the substance,” may be met). Specify if: In a controlled environment: This additional specifier is used if the individual is in an environment where access to the sub- stance is restricted. Coding based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If an other (or unknown) substance intoxication, other (or unknown) substance withdrawal, or another other (or unknown) substance– induced mental disorder is present, do not use the codes below for other (or unknown) substance use disorder. Instead, the comorbid other (or unknown) substance use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the other (or unknown) substance–induced disorder code (see the coding note for other (or unknown) substance intoxica- tion, other (or unknown) substance withdrawal, or specific other (or unknown) substance–induced mental disorder). For example, if there is comorbid other (or unknown) substance–induced depressive dis- order and other (or unknown) substance use disorder, only the other (or unknown) substance–induced depressive disorder code is given with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid other (or un- known) substance use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe: F19.14 for other (or unknown) substance use disorder with other (or unknown) substance–induced depressive disorder or F19.24 for a moderate or severe other (or unknown) substance use disorder with other (or un- known) substance–induced depressive disorder. Specify current severity: 305.90 (F19.10) Mild: Presence of 2–3 symptoms. 304.90 (F19.20) Moderate: Presence of 4–5 symptoms. 304.90 (F19.20) Severe: Presence of 6 or more symptoms.",
