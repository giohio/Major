Intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder fre- quently co-occur; to make comorbid diagnoses of autism spec- trum disorder and intellectual disability, social communication should be below that expected for general developmental level. Note: Individuals with a well-established DSM-IV diagnosis of autis- tic disorder, Asperger’s disorder, or pervasive developmental disor- der not otherwise specified should be given the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Individuals who have marked deficits in social communication, but whose symptoms do not otherwise meet criteria for autism spectrum disorder, should be evaluated for social (prag- matic) communication disorder. Specify if: With or without accompanying intellectual impairment With or without accompanying language impairment Associated with a known medical or genetic condition or en- vironmental factor (Coding note: Use additional code to iden- tify the associated medical or genetic condition.) Associated with another neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral disorder (Coding note: Use additional code[s] to identify the associated neurodevelopmental, mental, or behav- ioral disorder[s].) With catatonia (refer to the criteria for catatonia associated with another mental disorder, pp. 60–61, for definition). (Coding note: Use additional code 293.89 [F06.1] catatonia associated with au- tism spectrum disorder to indicate the presence of the comorbid catatonia.) 30 Neurodevelopmental Disorders TABLE 2 Severity levels for autism spectrum disorder Severity level Social communication Restricted, repetitive behaviors Level 3 Severe deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication Inflexibility of behavior, extreme difficulty “Requiring very skills cause severe impairments in functioning, very limited coping with change, or other restricted/ substantial initiation of social interactions, and minimal response to social repetitive behaviors markedly interfere support” overtures from others. For example, a person with few words with functioning in all spheres.

Level 2 Marked deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication Inflexibility of behavior, difficulty coping “Requiring skills; social impairments apparent even with supports in place; with change, or other restricted/repeti- substantial limited initiation of social interactions; and reduced or abnormal tive behaviors appear frequently enough support” responses to social overtures from others. For example, a person to be obvious to the casual observer and who speaks simple sentences, whose interaction is limited to interfere with functioning in a variety of narrow special interests, and who has markedly odd nonverbal contexts.

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder 31 Recording Procedures For autism spectrum disorder that is associated with a known medical or genetic condition or environmental factor, or with another neurode- velopmental, mental, or behavioral disorder, record autism spectrum disorder associated with (name of condition, disorder, or factor) (e.g., autism spectrum disorder associated with Rett syndrome). Severity should be recorded as level of support needed for each of the two psy- chopathological domains in Table 2 (e.g., “requiring very substantial support for deficits in social communication and requiring substantial support for restricted, repetitive behaviors”). Specification of “with accompanying intellectual impairment” or “without accompanying intellectual impairment” should be recorded next. Language impair- ment specification should be recorded thereafter. If there is accompa- nying language impairment, the current level of verbal functioning should be recorded (e.g., “with accompanying language impair- ment—no intelligible speech” or “with accompanying language im- pairment—phrase speech”). If catatonia is present, record separately “catatonia associated with autism spectrum disorder.” Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder A. A persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development, as characterized by (1) and/or (2): 1. Inattention: Six (or more) of the following symptoms have persisted for at least 6months to a degree that is inconsis- tent with developmental level and that negatively impacts di- rectly on social and academic/occupational activities: Note: The symptoms are not solely a manifestation of oppo- sitional behavior, defiance, hostility, or failure to understand 32 Neurodevelopmental Disorders tasks or instructions. For older adolescents and adults (age 17 and older), at least five symptoms are required. a. Often fails to give close attention to details or makes care- less mistakes in schoolwork, at work, or during other activ- ities (e.g., overlooks or misses details, work is inaccurate). b. Often has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities (e.g., has difficulty remaining focused during lectures, conversations, or lengthy reading). c. Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly (e.g., mind seems elsewhere, even in the absence of any obvious distraction). d. Often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace (e.g., starts tasks but quickly loses focus and is easily side- tracked). e. Often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities (e.g., dif- ficulty managing sequential tasks; difficulty keeping materi- als and belongings in order; messy, disorganized work; has poor time management; fails to meet deadlines). f. Often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort (e.g., schoolwork or homework; for older adolescents and adults, preparing reports, completing forms, reviewing lengthy papers). g. Often loses things necessary for tasks or activities (e.g., school materials, pencils, books, tools, wallets, keys, pa- perwork, eyeglasses, mobile telephones). h. Is often easily distracted by extraneous stimuli (for older adolescents and adults, may include unrelated thoughts). i. Is often forgetful in daily activities (e.g., doing chores, running errands; for older adolescents and adults, re- turning calls, paying bills, keeping appointments). 2. Hyperactivity and impulsivity: Six (or more) of the follow- ing symptoms have persisted for at least 6 months to a de- gree that is inconsistent with developmental level and that negatively impacts directly on social and academic/occupa- tional activities: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder 33 Note: The symptoms are not solely a manifestation of oppo- sitional behavior, defiance, hostility, or a failure to under- stand tasks or instructions. For older adolescents and adults (age 17 and older), at least five symptoms are required. a. Often fidgets with or taps hands or feet or squirms in seat. b. Often leaves seat in situations when remaining seated is expected (e.g., leaves his or her place in the classroom, in the office or other workplace, or in other situations that require remaining in place). c. Often runs about or climbs in situations where it is in- appropriate. (Note: In adolescents or adults, may be lim- ited to feeling restless.) d. Often unable to play or engage in leisure activities quietly. e. Is often “on the go,” acting as if “driven by a motor” (e.g., is unable to be or uncomfortable being still for extended time, as in restaurants, meetings; may be experienced by others as being restless or difficult to keep up with). f. Often talks excessively. g. Often blurts out an answer before a question has been completed (e.g., completes people’s sentences; cannot wait for turn in conversation). h. Often has difficulty waiting his or her turn (e.g., while waiting in line). i. Often interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into con- versations, games, or activities; may start using other people’s things without asking or receiving permission; for adolescents and adults, may intrude into or take over what others are doing). B. Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were present prior to age 12 years. C. Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms are pres- ent in two or more settings (e.g., at home, school, or work; with friends or relatives; in other activities). D. There is clear evidence that the symptoms interfere with, or re- duce the quality of, social, academic, or occupational functioning.",
