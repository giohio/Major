Continued sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use despite hav- ing persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of sedatives, hypnot- ics, or anxiolytics (e.g., arguments with a spouse about con- sequences of intoxication; physical fights). 7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of sedative, hypnotic, or anxio- lytic use. 8. Recurrent sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use in situations in which it is physically hazardous (e.g., driving an automo- bile or operating a machine when impaired by sedative, hyp- notic, or anxiolytic use). 9. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic. 10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: a. A need for markedly increased amounts of the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic to achieve intoxication or desired effect. b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic. Note: This criterion is not considered to be met for individu- als taking sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics under medical supervision. 11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: a. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics (refer to Criteria A and B of the criteria set for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdraw- al, pp. 265–266). b. Sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics (or a closely related substance, such as alcohol) are taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms. Note: This criterion is not considered to be met for individu- als taking sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics under medical supervision. Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder 263 Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with the excep- tion that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic,” may be met). In sustained remission: After full criteria for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder were previously met, none of the crite- ria for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic,” may be met). Specify if: In a controlled environment: This additional specifier is used if the individual is in an environment where access to sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics is restricted. Coding based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication; sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal; or another sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic- induced mental disorder is also present, do not use the codes below for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder. Instead, the comorbid sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced disorder (see the coding note for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication; sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal; or a specific sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced mental disorder). For example, if there is comorbid sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced depressive dis- order and sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, only the sed- ative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced depressive disorder code is given, with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe: F13.14 for mild sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder with sed- ative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced depressive disorder or F13.24 for a moderate or severe sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder with sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced depressive disorder.",
