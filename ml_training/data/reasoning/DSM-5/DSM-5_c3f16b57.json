  "text": "Specifiers for Bipolar and Related Disorders 87 B. Three (or more) of the following: 1. A distinct quality of depressed mood characterized by profound despondency, despair, and/or moroseness or by so-called empty mood. 2. Depression that is regularly worse in the morning. 3. Early-morning awakening (i.e., at least 2 hours before usual awakening). 4. Marked psychomotor agitation or retardation. 5. Significant anorexia or weight loss. 6. Excessive or inappropriate guilt. Note: The specifier “with melancholic features” is applied if these features are present at the most severe stage of the episode. There is a near-complete absence of the capacity for pleasure, not merely a diminution. A guideline for evalu- ating the lack of reactivity of mood is that even highly desired events are not associated with marked brightening of mood. Either mood does not brighten at all, or it brightens only par- tially (e.g., up to 20%–40% of normal for only minutes at a time). The “distinct quality” of mood that is characteristic of the “with melancholic features” specifier is experienced as qualitatively different from that during a nonmelancholic de- pressive episode. A depressed mood that is described as merely more severe, longer lasting, or present without a rea- son is not considered distinct in quality. Psychomotor chang- es are nearly always present and are observable by others. Melancholic features exhibit only a modest tendency to re- peat across episodes in the same individual. They are more frequent in inpatients, as opposed to outpatients; are less likely to occur in milder than in more severe major depres- sive episodes; and are more likely to occur in those with psy- chotic features. With atypical features: This specifier can be applied when these features predominate during the majority of days of the current or most recent major depressive episode. A. Mood reactivity (i.e., mood brightens in response to actual or potential positive events). B. Two (or more) of the following features: 88 Bipolar and Related Disorders 1. Significant weight gain or increase in appetite. 2. Hypersomnia. 3. Leaden paralysis (i.e., heavy, leaden feelings in arms or legs). 4. A long-standing pattern of interpersonal rejection sensi- tivity (not limited to episodes of mood disturbance) that results in significant social or occupational impairment. C. Criteria are not met for “with melancholic features” or “with catatonia” during the same episode. Note: “Atypical depression” has historical significance (i.e., atypical in contradistinction to the more classical agitated, “endogenous” presentations of depression that were the norm when depression was rarely diagnosed in outpatients and almost never in adolescents or younger adults) and to- day does not connote an uncommon or unusual clinical pre- sentation as the term might imply. Mood reactivity is the capacity to be cheered up when pre- sented with positive events (e.g., a visit from children, com- pliments from others). Mood may become euthymic (not sad) even for extended periods of time if the external circumstances remain favorable. Increased appetite may be manifested by an obvious increase in food intake or by weight gain. Hypersomnia may include either an extended period of nighttime sleep or daytime napping that totals at least 10 hours of sleep per day (or at least 2 hours more than when not depressed). Leaden pa- ralysis is defined as feeling heavy, leaden, or weighted down, usually in the arms or legs. This sensation is generally present for at least an hour a day but often lasts for many hours at a time. Unlike the other atypical features, pathological sensitivity to perceived interpersonal rejection is a trait that has an early onset and persists throughout most of adult life. Rejection sen- sitivity occurs both when the person is and is not depressed, though it may be exacerbated during depressive periods. With psychotic features: Delusions or hallucinations are pres- ent at any time in the episode. If psychotic features are present, specify if mood-congruent or mood-incongruent: Specifiers for Bipolar and Related Disorders 89 With mood-congruent psychotic features: During manic episodes, the content of all delusions and halluci- nations is consistent with the typical manic themes of grandiosity, invulnerability, etc., but may also include themes of suspiciousness or paranoia, especially with respect to others’ doubts about the individual’s capaci- ties, accomplishments, and so forth. With mood-incongruent psychotic features: The con- tent of delusions and hallucinations is inconsistent with the episode polarity themes as described above, or the content is a mixture of mood-incongruent and mood- congruent themes. With catatonia: This specifier can apply to an episode of mania or depression if catatonic features are present during most of the episode. See criteria for catatonia associated with a mental dis- order in the chapter “Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psy- chotic Disorders.” With peripartum onset: This specifier can be applied to the cur- rent or, if the full criteria are not currently met for a mood episode, most recent episode of mania, hypomania, or major depression in bipolar I or bipolar II disorder if onset of mood symptoms oc- curs during pregnancy or in the 4 weeks following delivery. Note: Mood episodes can have their onset either during preg- nancy or postpartum. Although the estimates differ according to the period of follow-up after delivery, between 3% and 6% of women will experience the onset of a major depressive epi- sode during pregnancy or in the weeks or months following delivery. Fifty percent of “postpartum” major depressive epi- sodes actually begin prior to delivery. Thus, these episodes are referred to collectively as peripartum episodes. Women with peripartum major depressive episodes often have severe anxiety and even panic attacks. Prospective studies have demonstrated that mood and anxiety symptoms during preg- nancy, as well as the “baby blues,” increase the risk for a post- partum major depressive episode. Peripartum-onset mood episodes can present either with or without psychotic features. Infanticide is most often asso- 90 Bipolar and Related Disorders ciated with postpartum psychotic episodes that are charac- terized by command hallucinations to kill the infant or delusions that the infant is possessed, but psychotic symp- toms can also occur in severe postpartum mood episodes without such specific delusions or hallucinations. Postpartum mood (major depressive or manic) episodes with psychotic features appear to occur in from 1 in 500 to 1 in 1,000 deliveries and may be more common in primiparous women. The risk of postpartum episodes with psychotic fea- tures is particularly increased for women with prior postpar- tum mood episodes but is also elevated for those with a prior history of a depressive or bipolar disorder (especially bipolar I disorder) and those with a family history of bipolar disorders. Once a woman has had a postpartum episode with psy- chotic features, the risk of recurrence with each subsequent delivery is between 30% and 50%. Postpartum episodes must be differentiated from delirium occurring in the postpar- tum period, which is distinguished by a fluctuating level of awareness or attention. The postpartum period is unique with respect to the degree of neuroendocrine alterations and psy- chosocial adjustments, the potential impact of breast-feed- ing on treatment planning, and the long-term implications of a history of postpartum mood disorder on subsequent family planning. With seasonal pattern: This specifier applies to the lifetime pat- tern of mood episodes. The essential feature is a regular season- al pattern of at least one type of episode (i.e., mania, hypomania, or depression). The other types of episodes may not follow this pattern. For example, an individual may have seasonal manias, but his or her depressions do not regularly occur at a specific time of year. A. There has been a regular temporal relationship between the onset of manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episodes and a particular time of the year (e.g., in the fall or winter) in bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. Note: Do not include cases in which there is an obvious ef- fect of seasonally related psychosocial stressors (e.g., regu- larly being unemployed every winter). Specifiers for Bipolar and Related Disorders 91 B. Full remissions (or a change from major depression to mania or hypomania or vice versa) also occur at a characteristic time of the year (e.g., depression disappears in the spring). C. In the last 2 years, the individual’s manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episodes have demonstrated a temporal seasonal relationship, as defined above, and no non-seasonal episodes of that polarity have occurred during that 2-year period. D. Seasonal manias, hypomanias, or depressions (as described above) substantially outnumber any nonseasonal manias, hypomanias, or depressions that may have occurred over the individual’s lifetime. Note: This specifier can be applied to the pattern of major de- pressive episodes in bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, or major depressive disorder, recurrent. The essential feature is the onset and remission of major depressive episodes at char- acteristic times of the year. In most cases, the episodes begin in fall or winter and remit in spring. Less commonly, there may be recurrent summer depressive episodes. This pattern of on- set and remission of episodes must have occurred during at least a 2-year period, without any nonseasonal episodes oc- curring during this period. In addition, the seasonal depressive episodes must substantially outnumber any nonseasonal de- pressive episodes over the individual’s lifetime. This specifier does not apply to those situations in which the pattern is better explained by seasonally linked psycho- social stressors (e.g., seasonal unemployment or school schedule). Major depressive episodes that occur in a seasonal pattern are often characterized by loss of energy, hyper- somnia, overeating, weight gain, and a craving for carbohy- drates. It is unclear whether a seasonal pattern is more likely in recurrent major depressive disorder or in bipolar disorders. However, within the bipolar disorders group, a seasonal pattern appears to be more likely in bipolar II disorder than in bipolar I disorder. In some individuals, the onset of manic or hypo- manic episodes may also be linked to a particular season. The prevalence of winter-type seasonal pattern appears to vary with latitude, age, and sex. Prevalence increases with higher latitudes. Age is also a strong predictor of seasonality, 92 Bipolar and Related Disorders with younger persons at higher risk for winter depressive episodes. Specify if: In partial remission: Symptoms of the immediately previous manic, hypomanic, or depressive episode are present, but full criteria are not met, or there is a period lasting less than 2 months without any significant symptoms of a manic, hypomanic, or ma- jor depressive episode following the end of such an episode. In full remission: During the past 2 months, no significant signs or symptoms of the disturbance were present. Specify current severity: Severity is based on the number of criterion symptoms, the severity of those symptoms, and the degree of functional disability. Mild: Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to meet the diagnostic criteria are present, the intensity of the symptoms is distressing but manageable, and the symptoms result in minor impairment in social or occupational functioning. Moderate: The number of symptoms, intensity of symptoms, and/ or functional impairment are between those specified for “mild” and “severe.” Severe: The number of symptoms is substantially in excess of those required to make the diagnosis, the intensity of the symp- toms is seriously distressing and unmanageable, and the symp- toms markedly interfere with social and occupational functioning.",
