First episode, currently in full remission: Full remission is a period of time after a previous episode during which no disorder- specific symptoms are present. Multiple episodes, currently in acute episode: Multiple epi- sodes may be determined after a minimum of two episodes (i.e., after a first episode, a remission and a minimum of one relapse). Multiple episodes, currently in partial remission Multiple episodes, currently in full remission Continuous: Symptoms fulfilling the diagnostic symptom criteria of the disorder are remaining for the majority of the illness course, with subthreshold symptom periods being very brief rel- ative to the overall course. Unspecified Specify current severity: Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms of psychosis, including delusions, hallucinations, disor- ganized speech, abnormal psychomotor behavior, and negative symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be rated for its current severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician- Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity in the chapter “Assessment Measures” in Section III of DSM-5.) Note: Diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder can be made without using this severity specifier. Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder 55 Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder A. Presence of one or both of the following symptoms: 1. Delusions. 2. Hallucinations. B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or lab- oratory findings of both (1) and (2): 1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication. 2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in Criterion A. C. The disturbance is not better explained by a psychotic disorder that is not substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent psychotic disorder could include the following: The symptoms preceded the onset of the substance/medica- tion use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute with- drawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence of an independent non-substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder (e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance/medica- tion-related episodes). D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Note: This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of sub- stance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and when they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medication]-induced psychotic disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the 56 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comor- bid with the substance-induced psychotic disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced psychotic disorder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced psychotic disorder”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced psychotic disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disor- der” or “severe [substance] use disorder” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid sub- stance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the substance-induced psychotic disorder.

With onset during withdrawal: If the criteria are met for with- drawal from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal. Specify current severity: Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms of psychosis, including delusions, hallucinations, ab- normal psychomotor behavior, and negative symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be rated for its current severity (most se- vere in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician-Rated Dimen- sions of Psychosis Symptom Severity in the chapter “Assess- ment Measures” in Section III of DSM-5.) Note: Diagnosis of substance/medication-induced psychotic dis- order can be made without using this severity specifier. Recording Procedures ICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced psy- chotic disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexa- methasone) that is presumed to be causing the delusions or hallucinations. The diagnostic code is selected from the table in- cluded in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For sub- stances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used. The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the substance- induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use 58 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders disorder. For example, in the case of delusions occurring during in- toxication in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.9 cocaine-induced psychotic disorder, with onset during intox- ication. An additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe cocaine use disorder is also given. When more than one substance is judged to play a sig- nificant role in the development of psychotic symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., 292.9 cannabis-induced psychotic disorder with onset during intoxication, with severe cannabis use disorder; 292.9 phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder, with onset during intoxication, with mild phencyclidine use disorder). ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced psy- chotic disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the delusions or hal- lucinations. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for “other substance” with no comorbid substance use should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “un- known substance” with no comorbid substance use should be used. When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid sub- stance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word “with,” followed by the name of the substance-induced psychotic disorder, followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal). For example, in the case of delusions oc- curring during intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine use disor- der, the diagnosis is F14.259 severe cocaine use disorder with cocaine- induced psychotic disorder, with onset during intoxication. A sepa- rate diagnosis of the comorbid severe cocaine use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced psychotic disorder occurs without a comor- bid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F16.959 phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder, with onset dur- ing intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of psychotic symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., F12.259 severe cannabis use disorder with cannabis-induced psychotic disorder, with onset during intoxi- Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition 59 cation; F16.159 mild phencyclidine use disorder with phencyclidine- induced psychotic disorder, with onset during intoxication). Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition A. Prominent hallucinations or delusions. B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or lab- oratory findings that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiolog- ical consequence of another medical condition. C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder. D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Specify whether: Code based on predominant symptom: 293.81 (F06.2) With delusions: If delusions are the predomi- nant symptom. 293.82 (F06.0) With hallucinations: If hallucinations are the predominant symptom. Coding note: Include the name of the other medical condition in the name of the mental disorder (e.g., 293.81 [F06.2] psychotic disorder due to malignant lung neoplasm, with delusions). The other medical condition should be coded and listed separately immediately before the psychotic disorder due to the medical condition (e.g., 162.9 [C34.90] malignant lung neoplasm; 293.81 [F06.2] psychotic disorder due to malignant lung neoplasm, with delusions). Specify current severity: Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms of psychosis, including delusions, hallucinations, ab- normal psychomotor behavior, and negative symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be rated for its current severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psy- 60 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders chosis Symptom Severity in the chapter “Assessment Measures” in Section III of DSM-5.) Note: Diagnosis of psychotic disorder due to another medical condition can be made without using this severity specifier. Catatonia Catatonia Associated With Another Mental Disorder (Catatonia Specifier) 293.89 (F06.1) A. The clinical picture is dominated by three (or more) of the follow- ing symptoms: 1. Stupor (i.e., no psychomotor activity; not actively relating to environment). 2. Catalepsy (i.e., passive induction of a posture held against gravity). 3. Waxy flexibility (i.e., slight, even resistance to positioning by examiner). 4. Mutism (i.e., no, or very little, verbal response [exclude if known aphasia]). 5. Negativism (i.e., opposition or no response to instructions or external stimuli). 6. Posturing (i.e., spontaneous and active maintenance of a posture against gravity). 7. Mannerism (i.e., odd, circumstantial caricature of normal actions). 8. Stereotypy (i.e., repetitive, abnormally frequent, non-goal- directed movements). 9. Agitation, not influenced by external stimuli. 10. Grimacing.",
