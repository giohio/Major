A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the substance, use the substance, or recover from its effects. 4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the substance. 5. Recurrent use of the substance resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home. 6. Continued use of the substance despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacer- bated by the effects of its use. 7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of use of the substance. 8. Recurrent use of the substance in situations in which it is physically hazardous. 9. Use of the substance is continued despite knowledge of hav- ing a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological prob- lem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by the substance. 10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: a. A need for markedly increased amounts of the sub- stance to achieve intoxication or desired effect. b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the substance. 11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: a. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for other (or un- known) substance (refer to Criteria A and B of the criteria sets for other [or unknown] substance withdrawal, pp. 280–281). b. The substance (or a closely related substance) is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for other (or unknown) sub- stance use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for other (or unknown) substance use disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with the exception Other (or Unknown) Substance Use Disorder 279 that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the substance,” may be met). In sustained remission: After full criteria for other (or unknown) substance use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for other (or unknown) substance use disorder have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or longer (with the excep- tion that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the substance,” may be met). Specify if: In a controlled environment: This additional specifier is used if the individual is in an environment where access to the sub- stance is restricted. Coding based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If an other (or unknown) substance intoxication, other (or unknown) substance withdrawal, or another other (or unknown) substance– induced mental disorder is present, do not use the codes below for other (or unknown) substance use disorder. Instead, the comorbid other (or unknown) substance use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the other (or unknown) substance–induced disorder code (see the coding note for other (or unknown) substance intoxica- tion, other (or unknown) substance withdrawal, or specific other (or unknown) substance–induced mental disorder). For example, if there is comorbid other (or unknown) substance–induced depressive dis- order and other (or unknown) substance use disorder, only the other (or unknown) substance–induced depressive disorder code is given with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid other (or un- known) substance use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe: F19.14 for other (or unknown) substance use disorder with other (or unknown) substance–induced depressive disorder or F19.24 for a moderate or severe other (or unknown) substance use disorder with other (or un- known) substance–induced depressive disorder. Specify current severity: 305.90 (F19.10) Mild: Presence of 2–3 symptoms. 304.90 (F19.20) Moderate: Presence of 4–5 symptoms. 304.90 (F19.20) Severe: Presence of 6 or more symptoms. 280 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders Other (or Unknown) Substance Intoxication A. The development of a reversible substance-specific syndrome attributable to recent ingestion of (or exposure to) a substance that is not listed elsewhere or is unknown. B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes that are attributable to the effect of the substance on the central nervous system (e.g., impaired motor coordination, psycho- motor agitation or retardation, euphoria, anxiety, belligerence, mood lability, cognitive impairment, impaired judgment, social withdrawal) and develop during, or shortly after, use of the substance. C. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disor- der, including intoxication with another substance. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.89. The ICD-10-CM code depends on whether there is a comorbid other (or unknown) sub- stance use disorder involving the same substance. If a mild other (or unknown) substance use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F19.129, and if a moderate or severe other (or unknown) sub- stance use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F19.229. If there is no comorbid other (or unknown) substance use disorder in- volving the same substance, then the ICD-10-CM code is F19.929. Other (or Unknown) Substance Withdrawal 292.0 (F19.239) A. Cessation of (or reduction in) use of a substance that has been heavy and prolonged. B. The development of a substance-specific syndrome shortly after the cessation of (or reduction in) substance use. C. The substance-specific syndrome causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder, includ- ing withdrawal from another substance.",
