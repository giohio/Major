A pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behav- ior, or vindictiveness lasting at least 6 months as evidenced by at least four symptoms from any of the following categories, and ex- hibited during interaction with at least one individual who is not a sibling. Angry/Irritable Mood 1. Often loses temper. 2. Is often touchy or easily annoyed. 3. Is often angry and resentful. Argumentative/Defiant Behavior 4. Often argues with authority figures or, for children and ado- lescents, with adults. 5. Often actively defies or refuses to comply with requests from authority figures or with rules. 6. Often deliberately annoys others. 7. Often blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior. Vindictiveness 8. Has been spiteful or vindictive at least twice within the past 6 months. Note: The persistence and frequency of these behaviors should be used to distinguish a behavior that is within normal limits from a behavior that is symptomatic. For children younger than 5 years, the behavior should occur on most days for a period of at least 6 months, unless otherwise noted (Criterion A8). For individuals 5 years or older, the behavior should occur at least once per week 219 220 Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders for at least 6 months, unless otherwise noted (Criterion A8). While these frequency criteria provide guidance on a minimal level of fre- quency to define symptoms, other factors should also be consid- ered, such as whether the frequency and intensity of the behaviors are outside a range that is normative for the individual’s develop- mental level, gender, and culture. B. The disturbance in behavior is associated with distress in the in- dividual or others in his or her immediate social context (e.g., family, peer group, work colleagues), or it impacts negatively on social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. C. The behaviors do not occur exclusively during the course of a psy- chotic, substance use, depressive, or bipolar disorder. Also, the criteria are not met for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Specify current severity: Mild: Symptoms are confined to only one setting (e.g., at home, at school, at work, with peers). Moderate: Some symptoms are present in at least two settings. Severe: Some symptoms are present in three or more settings. Intermittent Explosive Disorder 312.34 (F63.81) A. Recurrent behavioral outbursts representing a failure to control aggressive impulses as manifested by either of the following: 1. Verbal aggression (e.g., temper tantrums, tirades, verbal ar- guments or fights) or physical aggression toward property, animals, or other individuals, occurring twice weekly, on aver- age, for a period of 3 months. The physical aggression does not result in damage or destruction of property and does not result in physical injury to animals or other individuals. 2. Three behavioral outbursts involving damage or destruction of property and/or physical assault involving physical injury against animals or other individuals occurring within a 12- month period. Conduct Disorder 221 B. The magnitude of aggressiveness expressed during the recur- rent outbursts is grossly out of proportion to the provocation or to any precipitating psychosocial stressors. C. The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not premeditated (i.e., they are impulsive and/or anger-based) and are not committed to achieve some tangible objective (e.g., money, power, intimidation). D. The recurrent aggressive outbursts cause either marked distress in the individual or impairment in occupational or interpersonal func- tioning, or are associated with financial or legal consequences. E. Chronological age is at least 6 years (or equivalent developmen- tal level). F. The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, a psychotic dis- order, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disor- der) and are not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., head trauma, Alzheimer’s disease) or to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication). For children ages 6–18 years, aggressive behavior that occurs as part of an ad- justment disorder should not be considered for this diagnosis. Note: This diagnosis can be made in addition to the diagnosis of at- tention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, or autism spectrum disorder when recurrent impul- sive aggressive outbursts are in excess of those usually seen in these disorders and warrant independent clinical attention. Conduct Disorder A. A repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are violated, as manifested by the presence of at least three of the fol- lowing 15 criteria in the past 12 months from any of the categories below, with at least one criterion present in the past 6 months: Aggression to People and Animals 1. Often bullies, threatens, or intimidates others. 2. Often initiates physical fights.",
