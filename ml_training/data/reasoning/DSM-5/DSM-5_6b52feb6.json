Statement for Forensic Use of DSM-5 . . . . . . . . .13 This page intentionally left blank Use of the Manual The primary purpose of DSM-5 is to assist trained clinicians in the diagnosis of their patients’ mental disorders as part of a case formula- tion assessment that leads to a fully informed treatment plan for each individual. The symptoms contained in the respective diagnostic cri- teria sets do not constitute comprehensive definitions of underlying disorders, which encompass cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and physiological processes that are far more complex than can be de- scribed in these brief summaries. Rather, they are intended to summa- rize characteristic syndromes of signs and symptoms that point to an underlying disorder with a characteristic developmental history, bio- logical and environmental risk factors, neuropsychological and phys- iological correlates, and a typical clinical course. Approach to Clinical Case Formulation The case formulation for any given patient must involve a careful clini- cal history and concise summary of the social, psychological, and bio- logical factors that may have contributed to developing a given mental disorder. Hence, it is not sufficient to simply check off the symptoms in the diagnostic criteria to make a mental disorder diagnosis. Although a systematic check for the presence of these criteria as they apply to each patient will assure a more reliable assessment, the relative severity and valence of individual criteria and their contribution to a diagnosis re- quire clinical judgment. The symptoms in our diagnostic criteria are part of the relatively limited repertoire of human emotional responses to internal and external stresses that are generally maintained in a homeo- static balance without a disruption in normal functioning. It requires clinical training to recognize when the combination of predisposing, precipitating, perpetuating, and protective factors has resulted in a psy- chopathological condition in which physical signs and symptoms ex- ceed normal ranges. The ultimate goal of a clinical case formulation is to use the available contextual and diagnostic information in developing a comprehensive treatment plan that is informed by the individual’s cul- tural and social context. However, recommendations for the selection 3 4 Use of the Manual and use of the most appropriate evidence-based treatment options for each disorder are beyond the scope of this manual. Although decades of scientific effort have gone into developing the diagnostic criteria sets for the disorders included in Section II, it is well recognized that this set of categorical diagnoses does not fully describe the full range of mental disorders that individuals experi- ence and present to clinicians on a daily basis throughout the world. The range of genetic/environmental interactions over the course of human development affecting cognitive, emotional and behavioral function is virtually limitless. As a result, it is impossible to capture the full range of psychopathology in the categorical diagnostic cate- gories that we are now using. Hence, it is also necessary to include “other specified/unspecified” disorder options for presentations that do not fit exactly into the diagnostic boundaries of disorders in each chapter. In an emergency department setting, it may be possible to identify only the most prominent symptom expressions associated with a particular chapter—for example, delusions, hallucinations, ma- nia, depression, anxiety, substance intoxication, or neurocognitive symptoms—so that an “unspecified” disorder in that category is iden- tified until a fuller differential diagnosis is possible. Definition of a Mental Disorder Each disorder identified in Section II of the manual (excluding those in the chapters entitled “Medication-Induced Movement Disorders and Other Adverse Effects of Medication” and “Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention”) must meet the definition of a mental disorder. Although no definition can capture all aspects of all disorders in the range contained in DSM-5, the following elements are required: A mental disorder is a syndrome characterized by clini- cally significant disturbance in an individual’s cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental pro- cesses underlying mental functioning. Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress or disabil- ity in social, occupational, or other important activities. An expectable or culturally approved response to a common stressor or loss, such as the death of a loved one, is not Use of the Manual 5 a mental disorder. Socially deviant behavior (e.g., politi- cal, religious, or sexual) and conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are not mental disor- ders unless the deviance or conflict results from a dys- function in the individual, as described above. The diagnosis of a mental disorder should have clinical utility: it should help clinicians to determine prognosis, treatment plans, and po- tential treatment outcomes for their patients. However, the diagnosis of a mental disorder is not equivalent to a need for treatment. Need for treatment is a complex clinical decision that takes into consideration symptom severity, symptom salience (e.g., the presence of suicidal ide- ation), the patient’s distress (mental pain) associated with the symp- tom(s), disability related to the patient’s symptoms, risks and benefits of available treatments, and other factors (e.g., psychiatric symptoms complicating other illness). Clinicians may thus encounter individuals whose symptoms do not meet full criteria for a mental disorder but who demonstrate a clear need for treatment or care. The fact that some individuals do not show all symptoms indicative of a diagnosis should not be used to justify limiting their access to appropriate care. Approaches to validating diagnostic criteria for discrete categorical mental disorders have included the following types of evidence: ante- cedent validators (similar genetic markers, family traits, temperament, and environmental exposure), concurrent validators (similar neural substrates, biomarkers, emotional and cognitive processing, and symp- tom similarity), and predictive validators (similar clinical course and treatment response). In DSM-5, we recognize that the current diagnostic criteria for any single disorder will not necessarily identify a homoge- neous group of patients who can be characterized reliably with all of these validators. Available evidence shows that these validators cross existing diagnostic boundaries but tend to congregate more frequently within and across adjacent DSM-5 chapter groups. Until incontrovert- ible etiological or pathophysiological mechanisms are identified to fully validate specific disorders or disorder spectra, the most important stan- dard for the DSM-5 disorder criteria will be their clinical utility for the assessment of clinical course and treatment response of individuals grouped by a given set of diagnostic criteria. This definition of mental disorder was developed for clinical, pub- lic health, and research purposes. Additional information is usually 6 Use of the Manual required beyond that contained in the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria in or- der to make legal judgments on such issues as criminal responsibility, eligibility for disability compensation, and competency (see “Caution- ary Statement for Forensic Use of DSM-5” later in this manual). Criterion for Clinical Significance There have been substantial efforts by the DSM-5 Task Force and the World Health Organization (WHO) to separate the concepts of mental disorder and disability (impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning). In the WHO system, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) covers all diseases and disorders, while the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) provides a separate classification of global disability. The WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) is based on the ICF and has proven useful as a standardized measure of disability for men- tal disorders. However, in the absence of clear biological markers or clinically useful measurements of severity for many mental disorders, it has not been possible to completely separate normal and pathologi- cal symptom expressions contained in diagnostic criteria. This gap in information is particularly problematic in clinical situations in which the patient’s symptom presentation by itself (particularly in mild forms) is not inherently pathological and may be encountered in indi- viduals for whom a diagnosis of “mental disorder” would be inappro- priate. Therefore, a generic diagnostic criterion requiring distress or disability has been used to establish disorder thresholds, usually worded “the disturbance causes clinically significant distress or im- pairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of function- ing.” The text following the revised definition of a mental disorder acknowledges that this criterion may be especially helpful in determin- ing a patient’s need for treatment. Use of information from family members and other third parties (in addition to the individual) regard- ing the individual’s performance is recommended when necessary. Elements of a Diagnosis Diagnostic Criteria and Descriptors Diagnostic criteria are offered as guidelines for making diagnoses, and their use should be informed by clinical judgment. The text descriptions in DSM-5, including introductory sections of each diag- Use of the Manual 7 nostic chapter, can help support diagnosis (e.g., providing differen- tial diagnoses; describing the criteria more fully under “Diagnostic Features”). Following the assessment of diagnostic criteria, clinicians should consider the application of disorder subtypes and/or specifiers as appropriate. Severity and course specifiers should be applied to de- note the individual’s current presentation, but only when the full criteria are met. When full criteria are not met, clinicians should con- sider whether the symptom presentation meets criteria for an “other specified” or “unspecified” designation. Where applicable, specific criteria for defining disorder severity (e.g., mild, moderate, severe, extreme), descriptive features (e.g., with good to fair insight; in a controlled environment), and course (e.g., in partial remission, in full remission, recurrent) are provided with each diagnosis. On the basis of the clinical interview, text descriptions, criteria, and clinician judg- ment, a final diagnosis is made. The general convention in DSM-5 is to allow multiple diagnoses to be assigned for those presentations that meet criteria for more than one DSM-5 disorder. Subtypes and Specifiers Subtypes and specifiers (some of which are coded in the fourth, fifth, or sixth digit) are provided for increased specificity. Subtypes define mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive phenomenological sub- groupings within a diagnosis and are indicated by the instruction “Specify whether” in the criteria set. In contrast, specifiers are not in- tended to be mutually exclusive or jointly exhaustive, and as a con- sequence, more than one specifier may be given. Specifiers are indicated by the instruction “Specify” or “Specify if” in the criteria set. Specifiers provide an opportunity to define a more homogeneous subgrouping of individuals with the disorder who share certain fea- tures (e.g., major depressive disorder, with mixed features) and to convey information that is relevant to the management of the indi- vidual’s disorder, such as the “with other medical comorbidity” specifier in sleep-wake disorders. Although a fifth digit is sometimes assigned to code a subtype or specifier (e.g., 294.11 [F02.81] major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease, with behavioral disturbance) or severity (296.21 [F32.0] major depressive disorder, sin- gle episode, mild), the majority of subtypes and specifiers included in 8 Use of the Manual DSM-5 cannot be coded within the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM sys- tems and are indicated only by including the subtype or specifier af- ter the name of the disorder (e.g., social anxiety disorder [social phobia], performance type). Note that in some cases, a specifier or sub- type is codable in ICD-10-CM but not in ICD-9-CM. Accordingly, in some cases the 4th or 5th character codes for the subtypes or specifi- ers are provided only for the ICD-10-CM coding designations. A DSM-5 diagnosis is usually applied to the individual’s current presentation; previous diagnoses from which the individual has re- covered should be clearly noted as such. Specifiers indicating course (e.g., in partial remission, in full remission) may be listed after the di- agnosis and are indicated in a number of criteria sets. Where avail- able, severity specifiers are provided to guide clinicians in rating the intensity, frequency, duration, symptom count, or other severity indicator of a disorder. Severity specifiers are indicated by the in- struction “Specify current severity” in the criteria set and include dis- order-specific definitions. Descriptive features specifiers have also been provided in the criteria set and convey additional information that can inform treatment planning (e.g., obsessive-compulsive disorder, with poor insight). Not all disorders include course, severity, and/or descriptive features specifiers. Medication-Induced Movement Disorders and Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention In addition to important psychosocial and environmental factors, conditions that are not mental disorders but may be encountered by mental health clinicians are included. These conditions may be listed as a reason for clinical visit in addition to, or in place of, the mental disorders listed in Section II. A separate chapter is devoted to medi- cation-induced disorders and other adverse effects of medication that may be assessed and treated by clinicians in mental health prac- tice, such as akathisia, tardive dyskinesia, and dystonia. The descrip- tion of neuroleptic malignant syndrome is expanded from that provided in DSM-IV-TR to highlight the emergent and potentially life-threatening nature of this condition, and a new entry on anti- depressant discontinuation syndrome is provided. An additional chapter discusses other conditions that may be a focus of clinical at- tention. These include relational problems, problems related to abuse Use of the Manual 9 and neglect, problems with adherence to treatment regimens, obesity, antisocial behavior, and malingering. Principal Diagnosis When more than one diagnosis for an individual is given in an inpa- tient setting, the principal diagnosis is the condition established after study to be chiefly responsible for occasioning the admission of the individual. When more than one diagnosis is given for an individual in an outpatient setting, the reason for visit is the condition that is chiefly responsible for the ambulatory care medical services received during the visit. In most cases, the principal diagnosis or the reason for visit is also the main focus of attention or treatment. It is often dif- ficult (and somewhat arbitrary) to determine which diagnosis is the principal diagnosis or the reason for visit, especially when, for exam- ple, a substance-related diagnosis such as alcohol use disorder is accompanied by a non-substance-related diagnosis such as schizo- phrenia. For example, it may be unclear which diagnosis should be considered “principal” for an individual hospitalized with both schizophrenia and alcohol use disorder, because each condition may have contributed equally to the need for admission and treatment. The principal diagnosis is indicated by listing it first, and the remain- ing disorders are listed in order of focus of attention and treatment. When the principal diagnosis or reason for visit is a mental disorder due to another medical condition (e.g., major neurocognitive disor- der due to Alzheimer’s disease, psychotic disorder due to malignant lung neoplasm), ICD coding rules require that the etiological medi- cal condition be listed first. In that case, the principal diagnosis or reason for visit would be the mental disorder due to the medical con- dition, the second listed diagnosis. In most cases, the disorder listed as the principal diagnosis or the reason for visit is followed by the qualifying phrase “(principal diagnosis)” or “(reason for visit).” Provisional Diagnosis The specifier “provisional” can be used when there is a strong pre- sumption that the full criteria will ultimately be met for a disorder but not enough information is available to make a firm diagnosis. The clinician can indicate the diagnostic uncertainty by recording “(pro- visional)” following the diagnosis. For example, this diagnosis might be used when an individual who appears to have a major depressive 10 Use of the Manual disorder is unable to give an adequate history, and thus it cannot be established that the full criteria are met. Another use of the term pro- visional is for those situations in which differential diagnosis de- pends exclusively on the duration of illness. For example, a diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder requires a duration of less than 6 months but of at least 1 month and can only be given provisionally if as- signed before remission has occurred. Coding and Reporting Procedures Each disorder is accompanied by an identifying diagnostic and statisti- cal code, which is typically used by institutions and agencies for data collection and billing purposes. There are specific recording protocols for these diagnostic codes (identified as coding notes in the text) that were established by WHO, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics to ensure consistent international recording of prevalence and mortality rates for identified health condi- tions. For most clinicians, the codes are used to identify the diagnosis or reason for visit for CMS and private insurance service claims. The of- ficial coding system in use in the United States as of publication of this manual is ICD-9-CM. Official adoption of ICD-10-CM is scheduled to take place on October 1, 2014, and these codes, which are shown paren- thetically in this manual, should not be used until the official imple- mentation occurs. Both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes have been listed 1) preceding the name of the disorder in the classification and 2)accompanying the criteria set for each disorder. For some diagnoses (e.g., neurocognitive and substance/medication-induced disorders), the appropriate code depends on further specification and is listed within the criteria set for the disorder, as coding notes, and, in some cases, further clarified in a section on recording procedures. The names of some disorders are followed by alternative terms enclosed in paren- theses, which, in most cases, were the DSM-IV names for the disorders. Looking to the Future: Assessment and Monitoring Tools The various components of DSM-5 are provided to facilitate patient assessment and to aid in developing a comprehensive case formula- Use of the Manual 11 tion. Whereas the diagnostic criteria in Section II are well-established measures that have undergone extensive review, the assessment tools, a cultural formulation interview, and conditions for further study included in Section III are those for which we determined that the scientific evidence is not yet available to support widespread clin- ical use. These diagnostic aids and criteria are included to highlight the evolution and direction of scientific advances in these areas and to stimulate further research. Each of the measures in Section III is provided to aid in a compre- hensive assessment of individuals that will contribute to a diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to the individual presentation and clini- cal context. Where cultural dynamics are particularly important for diagnostic assessment, the cultural formulation interview should be considered as a useful aid to communication with the individual. Cross-cutting symptom and diagnosis-specific severity measures pro- vide quantitative ratings of important clinical areas that are designed to be used at the initial evaluation to establish a baseline for compar- ison with ratings on subsequent encounters to monitor changes and inform treatment planning. The use of such measures will undoubtedly be facilitated by dig- ital applications, and the measures are included in Section III to pro- vide for further evaluation and development. As with each DSM edition, the diagnostic criteria and the DSM-5 classification of mental disorders reflect the current consensus on the evolving knowledge in our field. This page intentionally left blank Cautionary Statement for Forensic Use of DSM-5 Although the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria and text are primarily designed to assist clinicians in conducting clinical assessment, case formulation, and treatment planning, DSM-5 is also used as a refer- ence for the courts and attorneys in assessing the forensic conse- quences of mental disorders. As a result, it is important to note that the definition of mental disorder included in DSM-5 was developed to meet the needs of clinicians, public health professionals, and research investigators rather than all of the technical needs of the courts and legal professionals. It is also important to note that DSM-5 does not provide treatment guidelines for any given disorder. When used appropriately, diagnoses and diagnostic information can assist legal decision makers in their determinations. For example, when the presence of a mental disorder is the predicate for a subse- quent legal determination (e.g., involuntary civil commitment), the use of an established system of diagnosis enhances the value and re- liability of the determination. By providing a compendium based on a review of the pertinent clinical and research literature, DSM-5 may facilitate legal decision makers’ understanding of the relevant char- acteristics of mental disorders. The literature related to diagnoses also serves as a check on ungrounded speculation about mental disorders and about the functioning of a particular individual. Finally, diag- nostic information about longitudinal course may improve decision making when the legal issue concerns an individual’s mental function- ing at a past or future point in time. However, the use of DSM-5 should be informed by an awareness of the risks and limitations of its use in forensic settings. When DSM-5 categories, criteria, and textual descriptions are employed for foren- sic purposes, there is a risk that diagnostic information will be mis- used or misunderstood. These dangers arise because of the imperfect fit between the questions of ultimate concern to the law and the in- formation contained in a clinical diagnosis. In most situations, the clinical diagnosis of a DSM-5 mental disorder such as intellectual dis- 13 14 Cautionary Statement for Forensic Use of DSM-5 ability (intellectual developmental disorder), schizophrenia, major neurocognitive disorder, gambling disorder, or pedophilic disorder does not imply that an individual with such a condition meets legal criteria for the presence of a mental disorder or a specified legal stan- dard (e.g., for competence, criminal responsibility, or disability). For the latter, additional information is usually required beyond that con- tained in the DSM-5 diagnosis, which might include information about the individual’s functional impairments and how these impairments affect the particular abilities in question. It is precisely because im- pairments, abilities, and disabilities vary widely within each diagnos- tic category that assignment of a particular diagnosis does not imply a specific level of impairment or disability. Use of DSM-5 to assess for the presence of a mental disorder by nonclinical, nonmedical, or otherwise insufficiently trained individ- uals is not advised. Nonclinical decision makers should also be cau- tioned that a diagnosis does not carry any necessary implications re- garding the etiology or causes of the individual’s mental disorder or the individual’s degree of control over behaviors that may be associ- ated with the disorder. Even when diminished control over one’s be- havior is a feature of the disorder, having the diagnosis in itself does not demonstrate that a particular individual is (or was) unable to con- trol his or her behavior at a particular time.",
