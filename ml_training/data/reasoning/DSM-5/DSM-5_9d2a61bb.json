There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or lab- oratory findings that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiolog- ical consequence of another medical condition. C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disor- der (e.g., a manic episode). D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Coding note: Include the name of the medical condition in the name of the mental disorder (e.g., 293.89 [F06.1]) catatonic disorder due to hepatic encephalopathy). The other medical condition should be coded and listed separately immediately before the catatonic disorder due to the medical condition (e.g., 572.2 [K71.90] hepatic encephalopathy; 293.89 [F06.1] catatonic disorder due to hepatic encephalopathy). Unspecified Catatonia This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character- istic of catatonia cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning but either the nature of the underlying mental disorder or other medical con- dition is unclear, full criteria for catatonia are not met, or there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings). Coding note: Code first 781.99 (R29.818) other symptoms involving nervous and musculoskeletal systems, followed by 293.89 (F06.1) unspecified catatonia. Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder 63 Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder 298.8 (F28) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character- istic of a schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa- tional, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders diagnostic class. The other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder cate- gory is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communi- cate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder. This is done by recording “other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder” followed by the specific rea- son (e.g., “persistent auditory hallucinations”). Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation include the following: 1. Persistent auditory hallucinations occurring in the absence of any other features. 2. Delusions with significant overlapping mood episodes: This includes persistent delusions with periods of overlapping mood episodes that are present for a substantial portion of the delu- sional disturbance (such that the criterion stipulating only brief mood disturbance in delusional disorder is not met). 3. Attenuated psychosis syndrome: This syndrome is character- ized by psychotic-like symptoms that are below a threshold for full psychosis (e.g., the symptoms are less severe and more tran- sient, and insight is relatively maintained). 4. Delusional symptoms in partner of individual with delusional disorder: In the context of a relationship, the delusional material from the dominant partner provides content for delusional belief by the individual who may not otherwise entirely meet criteria for de- lusional disorder. Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder 63 Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder 298.8 (F28) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character- istic of a schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa- tional, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders diagnostic class. The other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder cate- gory is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communi- cate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder.

The unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the rea- son that the criteria are not met for a specific schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).",
