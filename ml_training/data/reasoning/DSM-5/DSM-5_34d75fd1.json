Severe: Four or five symptoms with motor agitation. Note: Anxious distress has been noted as a prominent feature of both bipolar and major depressive disorder in both primary care and specialty mental health settings. High levels of anxi- ety have been associated with higher suicide risk, longer duration of illness, and greater likelihood of treatment non- response. As a result, it is clinically useful to specify accurately the presence and severity levels of anxious distress for treat- ment planning and monitoring of response to treatment. With mixed features: The mixed features specifier can apply to the current manic, hypomanic, or depressive episode in bipolar I or bipolar II disorder: Manic or hypomanic episode, with mixed features: A. Full criteria are met for a manic episode or hypomanic episode, and at least three of the following symptoms are present during the majority of days of the current or most recent episode of mania or hypomania: 1. Prominent dysphoria or depressed mood as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad or empty) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful). 2. Diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities (as indicated by either subjective account or observation made by others). 3. Psychomotor retardation nearly every day (observ- able by others; not merely subjective feelings of be- ing slowed down). 4. Fatigue or loss of energy. 5. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappro- priate guilt (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick). 6. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or Specifiers for Bipolar and Related Disorders 85 a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. B. Mixed symptoms are observable by others and repre- sent a change from the person’s usual behavior. C. For individuals whose symptoms meet full episode crite- ria for both mania and depression simultaneously, the di- agnosis should be manic episode, with mixed features, due to the marked impairment and clinical severity of full mania. D. The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physio- logical effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication other treatment). Depressive episode, with mixed features: A. Full criteria are met for a major depressive episode, and at least three of the following manic/hypomanic symp- toms are present during the majority of days of the cur- rent or most recent episode of depression: 1. Elevated, expansive mood. 2. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity. 3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking. 4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing. 5. Increase in energy or goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually). 6. Increased or excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual in- discretions, or foolish business investments). 7. Decreased need for sleep (feeling rested despite sleeping less than usual; to be contrasted with in- somnia). B. Mixed symptoms are observable by others and repre- sent a change from the person’s usual behavior. C. For individuals whose symptoms meet full episode crite- ria for both mania and depression simultaneously, the di- agnosis should be manic episode, with mixed features. 86 Bipolar and Related Disorders D. The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physio- logical effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication or other treatment). Note: Mixed features associated with a major depressive ep- isode have been found to be a significant risk factor for the development of bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. As a result, it is clinically useful to note the presence of this specifier for treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment. With rapid cycling (can be applied to bipolar I or bipolar II dis- order): Presence of at least four mood episodes in the previous 12 months that meet the criteria for manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episode. Note: Episodes are demarcated by either partial or full re- missions of at least 2 months or a switch to an episode of the opposite polarity (e.g., major depressive episode to manic episode). Note: The essential feature of a rapid-cycling bipolar disorder is the occurrence of at least four mood episodes during the previ- ous 12 months. These episodes can occur in any combination and order. The episodes must meet both the duration and symptom number criteria for a major depressive, manic, or hy- pomanic episode and must be demarcated by either a period of full remission or a switch to an episode of the opposite polarity. Manic and hypomanic episodes are counted as being on the same pole. Except for the fact that they occur more frequently, the episodes that occur in a rapid-cycling pattern are no differ- ent from those that occur in a non-rapid-cycling pattern. Mood episodes that count toward defining a rapid-cycling pattern ex- clude those episodes directly caused by a substance (e.g., co- caine, corticosteroids) or another medical condition. With melancholic features: A. One of the following is present during the most severe period of the current episode: 1. Loss of pleasure in all, or almost all, activities. 2. Lack of reactivity to usually pleasurable stimuli (does not feel much better, even temporarily, when something good happens).",
