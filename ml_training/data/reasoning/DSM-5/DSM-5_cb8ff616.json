Multiple episodes, currently in acute episode Multiple episodes, currently in partial remission Multiple episodes, currently in full remission Continuous: Symptoms fulfilling the diagnostic symptom criteria of the disorder are remaining for the majority of the illness course, with subthreshold symptom periods being very brief rel- ative to the overall course. Unspecified Specify current severity: Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms of psychosis, including delusions, hallucinations, disor- ganized speech, abnormal psychomotor behavior, and negative symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be rated for its current severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician- Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity in the chapter “Assessment Measures” in Section III of DSM-5.) Note: Diagnosis of delusional disorder can be made without us- ing this severity specifier. Brief Psychotic Disorder 298.8 (F23) A. Presence of one (or more) of the following symptoms. At least one of these must be (1), (2), or (3): 1. Delusions. 2. Hallucinations. 3. Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoher- ence). 4. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior. Note: Do not include a symptom if it is a culturally sanctioned re- sponse. 48 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders B. Duration of an episode of the disturbance is at least 1 day but less than 1 month, with eventual full return to premorbid level of functioning. C. The disturbance is not better explained by major depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features or another psychotic dis- order such as schizophrenia or catatonia, and is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition. Specify if: With marked stressor(s) (brief reactive psychosis): If symp- toms occur in response to events that, singly or together, would be markedly stressful to almost anyone in similar circumstances in the individual’s culture. Without marked stressor(s): If symptoms do not occur in re- sponse to events that, singly or together, would be markedly stressful to almost anyone in similar circumstances in the individ- ual’s culture. With postpartum onset: If onset is during pregnancy or within 4 weeks postpartum. Specify if: With catatonia (refer to the criteria for catatonia associated with another mental disorder, pp. 60–61, for definition). Coding note: Use additional code 293.89 (F06.1) catatonia associated with brief psychotic disorder to indicate the pres- ence of the comorbid catatonia. Specify current severity: Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms of psychosis, including delusions, hallucinations, disor- ganized speech, abnormal psychomotor behavior, and negative symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be rated for its current severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (present and severe).
