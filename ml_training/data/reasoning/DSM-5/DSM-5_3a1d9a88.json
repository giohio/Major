Preoccupation with one or more perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance that are not observable or appear slight to others. B. At some point during the course of the disorder, the individual has performed repetitive behaviors (e.g., mirror checking, exces- sive grooming, skin picking, reassurance seeking) or mental acts (e.g., comparing his or her appearance with that of others) in re- sponse to the appearance concerns. C. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impair- ment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The appearance preoccupation is not better explained by con- cerns with body fat or weight in an individual whose symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder. Specify if: With muscle dysmorphia: The individual is preoccupied with the idea that his or her body build is too small or insufficiently muscular. This specifier is used even if the individual is preoccu- pied with other body areas, which is often the case. Specify if: Indicate degree of insight regarding body dysmorphic disorder beliefs (e.g., “I look ugly” or “I look deformed”). With good or fair insight: The individual recognizes that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are definitely or probably not true or that they may or may not be true. With poor insight: The individual thinks that the body dysmor- phic disorder beliefs are probably true. With absent insight/delusional beliefs: The individual is com- pletely convinced that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are true. 132 Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders Hoarding Disorder 300.3 (F42) A. Persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, re- gardless of their actual value. B. This difficulty is due to a perceived need to save the items and to distress associated with discarding them. C. The difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromises their intended use. If living areas are uncluttered, it is only because of the interventions of third parties (e.g., family members, cleaners, authorities). D. The hoarding causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (including maintaining a safe environment for self and others). E. The hoarding is not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., brain injury, cerebrovascular disease, Prader-Willi syn- drome). F. The hoarding is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder (e.g., obsessions in obsessive-compulsive disor- der, decreased energy in major depressive disorder, delusions in schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder, cognitive deficits in major neurocognitive disorder, restricted interests in autism spectrum disorder). Specify if: With excessive acquisition: If difficulty discarding possessions is accompanied by excessive acquisition of items that are not needed or for which there is no available space. Specify if: With good or fair insight: The individual recognizes that hoard- ing-related beliefs and behaviors (pertaining to difficulty discard- ing items, clutter, or excessive acquisition) are problematic. With poor insight: The individual is mostly convinced that hoarding-related beliefs and behaviors (pertaining to difficulty discarding items, clutter, or excessive acquisition) are not prob- lematic despite evidence to the contrary.",
