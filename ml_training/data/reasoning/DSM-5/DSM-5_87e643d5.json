It also occurs with obesity (obesity hypoventilation disor- der), where it reflects a combination of increased work of breathing due to reduced chest wall compliance and ventilation-perfusion mis- match and variably reduced ventilatory drive. Such individuals usu- ally are characterized by body mass index of greater than 30 and hypercapnia during wakefulness (with a pCO of greater than 45), 2 without other evidence of hypoventilation. Specify current severity: Severity is graded according to the degree of hypoxemia and hy- percarbia present during sleep and evidence of end organ im- pairment due to these abnormalities (e.g., right-sided heart failure). The presence of blood gas abnormalities during wakeful- ness is an indicator of greater severity. Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders A. A persistent or recurrent pattern of sleep disruption that is primar- ily due to an alteration of the circadian system or to a misalign- ment between the endogenous circadian rhythm and the sleep- wake schedule required by an individual’s physical environment or social or professional schedule. B. The sleep disruption leads to excessive sleepiness or insomnia, or both. C. The sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or im- pairment in social, occupational, and other important areas of functioning. Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders 189 Coding note: For ICD-9-CM, code 307.45 for all subtypes. For ICD- 10-CM, code is based on subtype. Specify whether: 307.45 (G47.21) Delayed sleep phase type: A pattern of de- layed sleep onset and awakening times, with an inability to fall asleep and awaken at a desired or conventionally acceptable earlier time. Specify if: Familial: A family history of delayed sleep phase is present. Specify if: Overlapping with non-24-hour sleep-wake type: Delayed sleep phase type may overlap with another circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder, non-24-hour sleep-wake type. 307.45 (G47.22) Advanced sleep phase type: A pattern of ad- vanced sleep onset and awakening times, with an inability to re- main awake or asleep until the desired or conventionally acceptable later sleep or wake times. Specify if: Familial: A family history of advanced sleep phase is present. 307.45 (G47.23) Irregular sleep-wake type: A temporally disor- ganized sleep-wake pattern, such that the timing of sleep and wake periods is variable throughout the 24-hour period. 307.45 (G47.24) Non-24-hour sleep-wake type: A pattern of sleep-wake cycles that is not synchronized to the 24-hour envi- ronment, with a consistent daily drift (usually to later and later times) of sleep onset and wake times. 307.45 (G47.26) Shift work type: Insomnia during the major sleep period and/or excessive sleepiness (including inadvertent sleep) during the major awake period associated with a shift work schedule (i.e., requiring unconventional work hours). 307.45 (G47.20) Unspecified type Specify if: Episodic: Symptoms last at least 1 month but less than 3 months. Persistent: Symptoms last 3 months or longer. Recurrent: Two or more episodes occur within the space of 1 year.",
