The presence of persistent or recurrent experiences of deper- sonalization, derealization, or both: 1. Depersonalization: Experiences of unreality, detachment, or being an outside observer with respect to one’s thoughts, feelings, sensations, body, or actions (e.g., perceptual alter- ations, distorted sense of time, unreal or absent self, emo- tional and/or physical numbing). 2. Derealization: Experiences of unreality or detachment with respect to surroundings (e.g., individuals or objects are ex- perienced as unreal, dreamlike, foggy, lifeless, or visually distorted). B. During the depersonalization or derealization experiences, reality testing remains intact. C. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, medication) or another med- ical condition (e.g., seizures). E. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disor- der, such as schizophrenia, panic disorder, major depressive disorder, acute stress disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, or another dissociative disorder. 158 Dissociative Disorders Other Specified Dissociative Disorder 300.15 (F44.89) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character- istic of a dissociative disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the dissociative disorders diagnostic class. The other specified dissociative disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific dissociative disorder. This is done by recording “other specified dissociative dis- order” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “dissociative trance”). Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation include the following: 1. Chronic and recurrent syndromes of mixed dissociative symptoms: This category includes identity disturbance associ- ated with less-than-marked discontinuities in sense of self and agency, or alterations of identity or episodes of possession in an individual who reports no dissociative amnesia. 2. Identity disturbance due to prolonged and intense coercive persuasion: Individuals who have been subjected to intense coer- cive persuasion (e.g., brainwashing, thought reform, indoctrination while captive, torture, long-term political imprisonment, recruitment by sects/cults or by terror organizations) may present with pro- longed changes in, or conscious questioning of, their identity. 3. Acute dissociative reactions to stressful events: This cate- gory is for acute, transient conditions that typically last less than 1 month, and sometimes only a few hours or days. These condi- tions are characterized by constriction of consciousness; deper- sonalization; derealization; perceptual disturbances (e.g., time slowing, macropsia); micro-amnesias; transient stupor; and/or al- terations in sensory-motor functioning (e.g., analgesia, paralysis). 4. Dissociative trance: This condition is characterized by an acute narrowing or complete loss of awareness of immediate surround- ings that manifests as profound unresponsiveness or insens- itivity to environmental stimuli. The unresponsiveness may be Unspecified Dissociative Disorder 159 accompanied by minor stereotyped behaviors (e.g., finger move- ments) of which the individual is unaware and/or that he or she cannot control, as well as transient paralysis or loss of con- sciousness. The dissociative trance is not a normal part of a broadly accepted collective cultural or religious practice. Unspecified Dissociative Disorder 300.15 (F44.9) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character- istic of a dissociative disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the dissociative disorders diagnostic class. The unspec- ified dissociative disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific dissociative disorder, and includes presentations for which there is insufficient information to make a more specific di- agnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).",
