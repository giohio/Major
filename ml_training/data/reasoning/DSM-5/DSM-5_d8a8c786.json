  "text": "318 Neurocognitive Disorders C. There is clinically established Huntington’s disease, or risk for Huntington’s disease based on family history or genetic testing. D. The neurocognitive disorder is not attributable to another medical condition and is not better explained by another mental disorder. Coding note: For major neurocognitive disorder due to Huntington’s disease, with behavioral disturbance, code first 333.4 (G10) Hunting- ton’s disease, followed by 294.11 (F02.81) major neurocognitive dis- order due to Huntington’s disease, with behavioral disturbance. For major neurocognitive disorder due to Huntington’s disease, without behavioral disturbance, code first 333.4 (G10) Huntington’s disease, followed by 294.10 (F02.80) major neurocognitive disorder due to Huntington’s disease, without behavioral disturbance. For mild neurocognitive disorder due to Huntington’s disease, code 331.83 (G31.84). (Note: Do not use the additional code for Huntington’s disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder. B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or labo- ratory findings that the neurocognitive disorder is the pathophys- iological consequence of another medical condition. C. The cognitive deficits are not better explained by another mental disorder or another specific neurocognitive disorder (e.g., Alzhei- mer’s disease, HIV infection). Coding note: For major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition, with behavioral disturbance, code first the other medical condition, followed by the major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition, with behavioral disturbance (e.g., 340 [G35] multiple sclerosis, 294.11 [F02.81] major neurocognitive disor- der due to multiple sclerosis, with behavioral disturbance). For major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition, without be- havioral disturbance, code first the other medical condition, followed by the major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condi- Major or Mild NCD Due to Multiple Etiologies 319 tion, without behavioral disturbance (e.g., 340 [G35] multiple sclero- sis, 294.10 [F02.80] major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple sclerosis, without behavioral disturbance). For mild neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition, code 331.83 (G31.84). (Note: Do not use the additional code for the other medical condition. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Multiple Etiologies A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder. B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or lab- oratory findings that the neurocognitive disorder is the patho- physiological consequence of more than one etiological process, excluding substances (e.g., neurocognitive disorder due to Alz- heimer’s disease with subsequent development of vascular neu- rocognitive disorder). Note: Please refer to the diagnostic criteria for the various neu- rocognitive disorders due to specific medical conditions for guid- ance on establishing the particular etiologies. C. The cognitive deficits are not better explained by another mental disorder and do not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. Coding note: For major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiolo- gies, with behavioral disturbance, code 294.11 (F02.81); for major neu- rocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies, without behavioral disturbance, code 294.10 (F02.80). All of the etiological medical con- ditions (with the exception of vascular disease) should be coded and listed separately immediately before major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies (e.g., 331.0 [G30.9] Alzheimer’s disease; 331.82 [G31.83] Lewy body disease; 294.11 [F02.81] major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies, with behavioral disturbance). When a cerebrovascular etiology is contributing to the neurocogni- tive disorder, the diagnosis of vascular neurocognitive disorder should be listed in addition to major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies. For example, for a presentation of major neurocognitive dis- 320 Neurocognitive Disorders order due to both Alzheimer’s disease and vascular disease, with be- havioral disturbance, code the following: 331.0 (G30.9) Alzheimer’s disease; 294.11 (F02.81) major neurocognitive disorder due to multi- ple etiologies, with behavioral disturbance; 290.40 (F01.51) major vas- cular neurocognitive disorder, with behavioral disturbance. For mild neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies, code 331.83 (G31.84). (Note: Do not use the additional codes for the eti- ologies. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder 799.59 (R41.9) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character- istic of a neurocognitive disorder that cause clinically significant dis- tress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the neurocognitive disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified neurocognitive disorder category is used in situations in which the precise etiology cannot be determined with sufficient cer- tainty to make an etiological attribution. Coding note: For unspecified major or mild neurocognitive disorder, code 799.59 (R41.9). (Note: Do not use additional codes for any pre- sumed etiological medical conditions. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but may be indicated in writing.) Personality Disorders General Personality Disorder A. An enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that devi- ates markedly from the expectations of the individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas: 1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events). 2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriate- ness of emotional response). 3.
