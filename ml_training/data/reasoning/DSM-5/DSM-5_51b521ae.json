  "text": "Cannabis Intoxication 241 In sustained remission: After full criteria for cannabis use dis- order were previously met, none of the criteria for cannabis use disorder have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use cannabis,” may be present). Specify if: In a controlled environment: This additional specifier is used if the individual is in an environment where access to cannabis is restricted. Code based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If a can- nabis intoxication, cannabis withdrawal, or another cannabis-induced mental disorder is also present, do not use the codes below for cannabis use disorder. Instead, the comorbid cannabis use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the cannabis-induced disorder code (see the cod- ing note for cannabis intoxication, cannabis withdrawal, or a specific cannabis-induced mental disorder). For example, if there is comorbid cannabis-induced anxiety disorder and cannabis use disorder, only the cannabis-induced anxiety disorder code is given, with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid cannabis use disorder is mild, moder- ate, or severe: F12.180 for mild cannabis use disorder with cannabis- induced anxiety disorder or F12.280 for a moderate, or severe cannabis use disorder with cannabis-induced anxiety disorder. Specify current severity: 305.20 (F12.10) Mild: Presence of 2–3 symptoms. 304.30 (F12.20) Moderate: Presence of 4–5 symptoms. 304.30 (F12.20) Severe: Presence of 6 or more symptoms. Cannabis Intoxication A. Recent use of cannabis. B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., impaired motor coordination, euphoria, anxiety, sensation of slowed time, impaired judgment, social withdrawal) that developed during, or shortly after, cannabis use. C. Two (or more) of the following signs or symptoms developing within 2 hours of cannabis use: 242 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders 1. Conjunctival injection. 2. Increased appetite. 3. Dry mouth. 4. Tachycardia. D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disor- der, including intoxication with another substance. Specify if: With perceptual disturbances: Hallucinations with intact reality testing or auditory, visual, or tactile illusions occur in the absence of a delirium. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.89. The ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid cannabis use disorder and whether or not there are perceptual disturbances. For cannabis intoxication, without perceptual disturbances: If a mild cannabis use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F12.129, and if a moderate or severe cannabis use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F12.229. If there is no comor- bid cannabis use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F12.929. For cannabis intoxication, with perceptual disturbances: If a mild cannabis use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F12.122, and if a moderate or severe cannabis use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F12.222. If there is no comor- bid cannabis use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F12.922. Cannabis Withdrawal 292.0 (F12.288) A. Cessation of cannabis use that has been heavy and prolonged (i.e., usually daily or almost daily use over a period of at least a few months). B. Three (or more) of the following signs and symptoms develop within approximately 1 week after Criterion A: 1. Irritability, anger, or aggression. 2. Nervousness or anxiety. Cannabis Withdrawal 243 3. Sleep difficulty (e.g., insomnia, disturbing dreams). 4. Decreased appetite or weight loss. 5. Restlessness. 6. Depressed mood. 7. At least one of the following physical symptoms causing significant discomfort: abdominal pain, shakiness/tremors, sweating, fever, chills, or headache. C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disor- der, including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.0. The ICD-10-CM code for cannabis withdrawal is F12.288. Note that the ICD-10-CM code indi- cates the comorbid presence of a moderate or severe cannabis use disorder, reflecting the fact that cannabis withdrawal can only occur in the presence of a moderate or severe cannabis use disorder. It is not permissible to code a comorbid mild cannabis use disorder with cannabis withdrawal. Other Cannabis-Induced Disorders The following cannabis-induced disorders are described in other chapters of the book with disorders with which they share phenome- nology (see the substance/medication-induced mental disorders in these chapters): cannabis-induced psychotic disorder (“Schizophre- nia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders”); cannabis-induced anxiety disorder (“Anxiety Disorders”); and cannabis-induced sleep disorder (“Sleep-Wake Disorders”). For cannabis intoxication delir- ium, see the criteria and discussion of delirium in the chapter “Neu- rocognitive Disorders.” These cannabis-induced disorders are diagnosed instead of cannabis intoxication or cannabis withdrawal when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention.",
