  "text": "206 Sexual Dysfunctions 3. Marked fear or anxiety about vulvovaginal or pelvic pain in anticipation of, during, or as a result of vaginal penetration. 4. Marked tensing or tightening of the pelvic floor muscles dur- ing attempted vaginal penetration. B. The symptoms in Criterion A have persisted for a minimum dura- tion of approximately 6 months. C. The symptoms in Criterion A cause clinically significant distress in the individual. D. The sexual dysfunction is not better explained by a nonsexual men- tal disorder or as a consequence of a severe relationship distress (e.g., partner violence) or other significant stressors and is not at- tributable to the effects of a substance/medication or another medical condition. Specify whether: Lifelong: The disturbance has been present since the individual became sexually active. Acquired: The disturbance began after a period of relatively nor- mal sexual function. Specify current severity: Mild: Evidence of mild distress over the symptoms in Criterion A. Moderate: Evidence of moderate distress over the symptoms in Criterion A. Severe: Evidence of severe or extreme distress over the symp- toms in Criterion A. Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder 302.71 (F52.0) A. Persistently or recurrently deficient (or absent) sexual/erotic thoughts or fantasies and desire for sexual activity. The judgment of deficiency is made by the clinician, taking into account factors that affect sexual functioning, such as age and general and so- ciocultural contexts of the individual’s life. B. The symptoms in Criterion A have persisted for a minimum dura- tion of approximately 6 months. Premature (Early) Ejaculation 207 C. The symptoms in Criterion A cause clinically significant distress in the individual. D. The sexual dysfunction is not better explained by a nonsexual mental disorder or as a consequence of severe relationship dis- tress or other significant stressors and is not attributable to the effects of a substance/medication or another medical condition. Specify whether: Lifelong: The disturbance has been present since the individual became sexually active. Acquired: The disturbance began after a period of relatively nor- mal sexual function. Specify whether: Generalized: Not limited to certain types of stimulation, situa- tions, or partners. Situational: Only occurs with certain types of stimulation, situa- tions, or partners. Specify current severity: Mild: Evidence of mild distress over the symptoms in Criterion A. Moderate: Evidence of moderate distress over the symptoms in Criterion A. Severe: Evidence of severe or extreme distress over the symp- toms in Criterion A. Premature (Early) Ejaculation 302.75 (F52.4) A. A persistent or recurrent pattern of ejaculation occurring during partnered sexual activity within approximately 1 minute following vaginal penetration and before the individual wishes it. Note: Although the diagnosis of premature (early) ejaculation may be applied to individuals engaged in nonvaginal sexual ac- tivities, specific duration criteria have not been established for these activities. B. The symptom in Criterion A must have been present for at least 6 months and must be experienced on almost all or all (approxi- 208 Sexual Dysfunctions mately 75%–100%) occasions of sexual activity (in identified sit- uational contexts or, if generalized, in all contexts). C. The symptom in Criterion A causes clinically significant distress in the individual. D. The sexual dysfunction is not better explained by a nonsexual mental disorder or as a consequence of severe relationship dis- tress or other significant stressors and is not attributable to the effects of a substance/medication or another medical condition. Specify whether: Lifelong: The disturbance has been present since the individual became sexually active. Acquired: The disturbance began after a period of relatively nor- mal sexual function. Specify whether: Generalized: Not limited to certain types of stimulation, situa- tions, or partners. Situational: Only occurs with certain types of stimulation, situa- tions, or partners. Specify current severity: Mild: Ejaculation occurring within approximately 30 seconds to 1 minute of vaginal penetration. Moderate: Ejaculation occurring within approximately 15–30 sec- onds of vaginal penetration. Severe: Ejaculation occurring prior to sexual activity, at the start of sexual activity, or within approximately 15 seconds of vaginal penetration. Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction A. A clinically significant disturbance in sexual function is predomi- nant in the clinical picture. B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or lab- oratory findings of both (1) and (2): Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction 209 1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication. 2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in Criterion A. C. The disturbance is not better explained by a sexual dysfunction that is not substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent sexual dysfunction could include the following: The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medica- tion use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute with- drawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence sug- gesting the existence of an independent non-substance/ medication-induced sexual dysfunction (e.g., a history of re- current non-substance/medication-related episodes). D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress in the indi- vidual. Note: This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of sub- stance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medication]-induced sexual dysfunctions are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced sexual dysfunction, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced sexual dysfunction (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced sexual dysfunction”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance- induced sexual dysfunction, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disor- 210 Sexual Dysfunctions der (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the sub- stance-induced sexual dysfunction.

With onset during withdrawal: If criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal. With onset after medication use: Symptoms may appear either at initiation of medication or after a modification or change in use. Specify current severity: Mild: Occurs on 25%–50% of occasions of sexual activity. Moderate: Occurs on 50%–75% of occasions of sexual activity. Severe: Occurs on 75% or more of occasions of sexual activity.",
