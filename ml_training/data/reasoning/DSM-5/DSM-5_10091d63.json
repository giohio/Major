Such evidence of an inde- pendent sleep disorder could include the following: The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medica- tion use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute with- drawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence sug- gesting the existence of an independent non-substance/ medication-induced sleep disorder (e.g., a history of recur- rent non-substance/medication-related episodes). D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Note: This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of sub- stance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptom in Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and when they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medication]-induced sleep disorders are indicated in the ta- ble below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced sleep disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced sleep disorder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced sleep disorder”). If a moderate or severe sub- stance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced sleep dis- order, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disor- der” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disor- der. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one- time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the substance-induced sleep dis- order. A moderate or severe tobacco use disorder is required in order to code a tobacco-induced sleep disorder; it is not permissible to code a comorbid mild tobacco use disorder or no tobacco use disorder with a tobacco-induced sleep disorder.

Daytime sleepiness type: Characterized by predominant com- plaint of excessive sleepiness/fatigue during waking hours or, less commonly, a long sleep period. Parasomnia type: Characterized by abnormal behavioral events during sleep. Mixed type: Characterized by a substance/medication-induced sleep problem characterized by multiple types of sleep symp- toms, but no symptom clearly predominates. Specify if (see Table 1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addic- tive Disorders” for diagnoses associated with substance class): 196 Sleep-Wake Disorders With onset during intoxication: This specifier should be used if criteria are met for intoxication with the substance/medication and symptoms developed during the intoxication period. With onset during discontinuation/withdrawal: This specifier should be used if criteria are met for discontinuation/withdrawal from the substance/medication and symptoms developed during, or shortly after, discontinuation of the substance/medication. Recording Procedures ICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced sleep disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, bupropion) that is presumed to be causing the sleep disturbance. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., bupropion), the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used. The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during discontinuation/with- drawal), followed by the subtype designation (i.e., insomnia type, daytime sleepiness type, parasomnia type, mixed type). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the substance- induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of insomnia occurring during with- drawal in a man with a severe lorazepam use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.85 lorazepam-induced sleep disorder, with onset during with- drawal, insomnia type. An additional diagnosis of 304.10 severe lo- razepam use disorder is also given. When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of the sleep dis- turbance, each should be listed separately (e.g., 292.85 alcohol-in- duced sleep disorder, with onset during intoxication, insomnia type; 292.85 cocaine-induced sleep disorder, with onset during intoxica- tion, insomnia type). ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced sleep disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, bupropion) Other Specified Insomnia Disorder 197 that is presumed to be causing the sleep disturbance. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid sub- stance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., bupropion), the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “un- known substance” should be used. When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid sub- stance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word “with,” followed by the name of the substance-induced sleep disor- der, followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxi- cation, onset during discontinuation/withdrawal), followed by the subtype designation (i.e., insomnia type, daytime sleepiness type, parasomnia type, mixed type). For example, in the case of insomnia occurring during withdrawal in a man with a severe lorazepam use disorder, the diagnosis is F13.282 severe lorazepam use disorder with lorazepam-induced sleep disorder, with onset during withdrawal, insomnia type. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe loraze- pam use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced sleep disor- der occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., with medication use), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F19.982 bupropion-induced sleep disorder, with onset during medication use, insomnia type). When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of the sleep dis- turbance, each should be listed separately (e.g., F10.282 severe alco- hol use disorder with alcohol-induced sleep disorder, with onset during intoxication, insomnia type; F14.282 severe cocaine use disor- der with cocaine-induced sleep disorder, with onset during intoxica- tion, insomnia type). Other Specified Insomnia Disorder 780.52 (G47.09) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character- istic of insomnia disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of func- tioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for insomnia dis- 198 Sleep-Wake Disorders order or any of the disorders in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic class. The other specified insomnia disorder category is used in situ- ations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for insomnia disorder or any specific sleep-wake disorder. This is done by record- ing “other specified insomnia disorder” followed by the specific rea- son (e.g., “brief insomnia disorder”). Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation include the following: 1. Brief insomnia disorder: Duration is less than 3 months. 2. Restricted to nonrestorative sleep: Predominant complaint is nonrestorative sleep unaccompanied by other sleep symptoms such as difficulty falling asleep or remaining asleep. Unspecified Insomnia Disorder 780.52 (G47.00) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character- istic of insomnia disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of func- tioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for insomnia dis- order or any of the disorders in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified insomnia disorder category is used in situa- tions in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for insomnia disorder or a specific sleep-wake disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient in- formation to make a more specific diagnosis. Other Specified Hypersomnolence Disorder 780.54 (G47.19) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character- istic of hypersomnolence disorder that cause clinically significant dis- tress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for hyper- Unspecified Hypersomnolence Disorder 199 somnolence disorder or any of the disorders in the sleep-wake disor- ders diagnostic class. The other specified hypersomnolence disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to com- municate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for hypersomnolence disorder or any specific sleep-wake dis- order. This is done by recording “other specified hypersomnolence disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “brief-duration hyper- somnolence,” as in Kleine-Levin syndrome). Unspecified Hypersomnolence Disorder 780.54 (G47.10) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character- istic of hypersomnolence disorder that cause clinically significant dis- tress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for hyper- somnolence disorder or any of the disorders in the sleep-wake disor- ders diagnostic class. The unspecified hypersomnolence disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for hypersomnolence disorder or a specific sleep-wake disorder, and includes presenta- tions in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis. Other Specified Sleep-Wake Disorder 780.59 (G47.8) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character- istic of a sleep-wake disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic class and do not qualify for a diagnosis of other specified insomnia disorder or other specified hypersomnolence disorder. The other specified sleep-wake disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses 200 Sleep-Wake Disorders to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific sleep-wake disorder. This is done by recording “other specified sleep-wake disorder” followed by the spe- cific reason (e.g., “repeated arousals during rapid eye movement sleep without polysomnography or history of Parkinson’s disease or other synucleinopathy”). Unspecified Sleep-Wake Disorder 780.59 (G47.9) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character- istic of a sleep-wake disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic class and do not qualify for a diagnosis of unspecified insomnia disorder or unspeci- fied hypersomnolence disorder. The unspecified sleep-wake disor- der category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific sleep- wake disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insuffi- cient information to make a more specific diagnosis.",
