Continued stimulant use despite having persistent or recur- rent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the stimulant. 7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of stimulant use. 8. Recurrent stimulant use in situations in which it is physically hazardous. 9. Stimulant use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by the stim- ulant. 10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: a. A need for markedly increased amounts of the stimulant to achieve intoxication or desired effect. b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the stimulant. Note: This criterion is not considered to be met for those tak- ing stimulant medications solely under appropriate medical supervision, such as medications for attention-deficit/hyper- activity disorder or narcolepsy. 11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: a. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for the stimulant (refer to Criteria A and B of the criteria set for stimulant withdrawal, p. 272). b. The stimulant (or a closely related substance) is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms. Note: This criterion is not considered to be met for those tak- ing stimulant medications solely under appropriate medical supervision, such as medications for attention-deficit/hyper- activity disorder or narcolepsy. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for stimulant use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for stimulant use disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the stimulant,” may be met). Stimulant Use Disorder 269 In sustained remission: After full criteria for stimulant use dis- order were previously met, none of the criteria for stimulant use disorder have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the stimulant,” may be met). Specify if: In a controlled environment: This additional specifier is used if the individual is in an environment where access to stimulants is restricted. Coding based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If an amphetamine intoxication, amphetamine withdrawal, or another am- phetamine-induced mental disorder is also present, do not use the codes below for amphetamine use disorder. Instead, the comorbid amphetamine use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the am- phetamine-induced disorder code (see the coding note for amphet- amine intoxication, amphetamine withdrawal, or a specific amphet- amine-induced mental disorder). For example, if there is comorbid amphetamine-type or other stimulant-induced depressive disorder and amphetamine-type or other stimulant use disorder, only the amphet- amine-type or other stimulant-induced depressive disorder code is given, with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid amphet- amine-type or other stimulant use disorder is mild, moderate, or se- vere: F15.14 for mild amphetamine-type or other stimulant use disor- der with amphetamine-type or other stimulant-induced depressive disorder or F15.24 for a moderate or severe amphetamine-type or other stimulant use disorder with amphetamine-type or other stimu- lant-induced depressive disorder. Similarly, if there is comorbid co- caine-induced depressive disorder and cocaine use disorder, only the cocaine-induced depressive disorder code is given, with the 4th char- acter indicating whether the comorbid cocaine use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe: F14.14 for mild cocaine use disorder with co- caine-induced depressive disorder or F14.24 for a moderate or severe cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced depressive disorder. Specify current severity: Mild: Presence of 2–3 symptoms 305.70 (F15.10) Amphetamine-type substance 305.60 (F14.10) Cocaine 305.70 (F15.10) Other or unspecified stimulant 270 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders Moderate: Presence of 4–5 symptoms 304.40 (F15.20) Amphetamine-type substance 304.20 (F14.20) Cocaine 304.40 (F15.20) Other or unspecified stimulant Severe: Presence of 6 or more symptoms 304.40 (F15.20) Amphetamine-type substance 304.20 (F14.20) Cocaine 304.40 (F15.20) Other or unspecified stimulant Stimulant Intoxication A. Recent use of an amphetamine-type substance, cocaine, or other stimulant. B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., euphoria or affective blunting; changes in socia- bility; hypervigilance; interpersonal sensitivity; anxiety, tension, or anger; stereotyped behaviors; impaired judgment) that devel- oped during, or shortly after, use of a stimulant. C. Two (or more) of the following signs or symptoms, developing during, or shortly after, stimulant use: 1. Tachycardia or bradycardia. 2. Pupillary dilation. 3. Elevated or lowered blood pressure. 4. Perspiration or chills. 5. Nausea or vomiting. 6. Evidence of weight loss. 7. Psychomotor agitation or retardation. 8. Muscular weakness, respiratory depression, chest pain, or cardiac arrhythmias. 9. Confusion, seizures, dyskinesias, dystonias, or coma. D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disor- der, including intoxication with another substance.",
