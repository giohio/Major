The magnitude of aggressiveness expressed during the recur- rent outbursts is grossly out of proportion to the provocation or to any precipitating psychosocial stressors. C. The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not premeditated (i.e., they are impulsive and/or anger-based) and are not committed to achieve some tangible objective (e.g., money, power, intimidation). D. The recurrent aggressive outbursts cause either marked distress in the individual or impairment in occupational or interpersonal func- tioning, or are associated with financial or legal consequences. E. Chronological age is at least 6 years (or equivalent developmen- tal level). F. The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, a psychotic dis- order, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disor- der) and are not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., head trauma, Alzheimer’s disease) or to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication). For children ages 6–18 years, aggressive behavior that occurs as part of an ad- justment disorder should not be considered for this diagnosis. Note: This diagnosis can be made in addition to the diagnosis of at- tention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, or autism spectrum disorder when recurrent impul- sive aggressive outbursts are in excess of those usually seen in these disorders and warrant independent clinical attention. Conduct Disorder A. A repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are violated, as manifested by the presence of at least three of the fol- lowing 15 criteria in the past 12 months from any of the categories below, with at least one criterion present in the past 6 months: Aggression to People and Animals 1. Often bullies, threatens, or intimidates others. 2. Often initiates physical fights. 222 Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders 3. Has used a weapon that can cause serious physical harm to others (e.g., a bat, brick, broken bottle, knife, gun). 4. Has been physically cruel to people. 5. Has been physically cruel to animals. 6. Has stolen while confronting a victim (e.g., mugging, purse snatching, extortion, armed robbery). 7. Has forced someone into sexual activity. Destruction of Property 8. Has deliberately engaged in fire setting with the intention of causing serious damage. 9. Has deliberately destroyed others’ property (other than by fire setting). Deceitfulness or Theft 10. Has broken into someone else’s house, building, or car. 11. Often lies to obtain goods or favors or to avoid obligations (i.e., “cons” others). 12. Has stolen items of nontrivial value without confronting a vic- tim (e.g., shoplifting, but without breaking and entering; forg- ery). Serious Violations of Rules 13. Often stays out at night despite parental prohibitions, begin- ning before age 13 years. 14. Has run away from home overnight at least twice while living in the parental or parental surrogate home, or once without returning for a lengthy period. 15. Is often truant from school, beginning before age 13 years. B. The disturbance in behavior causes clinically significant impair- ment in social, academic, or occupational functioning. C. If the individual is age 18 years or older, criteria are not met for antisocial personality disorder.
