No evidence of mixed etiology (i.e., absence of other neuro- degenerative or cerebrovascular disease, or another neuro- logical or systemic disease or condition likely contributing to cognitive decline). D. The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular dis- ease, another neurodegenerative disease, the effects of a sub- stance, or another mental, neurological, or systemic disorder. Coding note: For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to Alz- heimer’s disease, with behavioral disturbance, code first 331.0 (G30.9) Alzheimer’s disease, followed by 294.11 (F02.81) major neu- rocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease. For probable neuro- cognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease, without behavioral disturbance, code first 331.0 (G30.9) Alzheimer’s disease, followed by 294.10 (F02.80) major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease, without behavioral disturbance. For possible major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s dis- ease, code 331.9 (G31.9) possible major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease. (Note: Do not use the additional code for Alzheimer’s disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) For mild neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease, code 331.83 (G31.84). (Note: Do not use the additional code for Alzheim- er’s disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) Major or Mild Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder. B. The disturbance has insidious onset and gradual progression. C. Either (1) or (2): 1. Behavioral variant: a. Three or more of the following behavioral symptoms: i. Behavioral disinhibition. ii. Apathy or inertia. iii. Loss of sympathy or empathy. Major or Mild Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder 307 iv. Perseverative, stereotyped or compulsive/ritualistic behavior. v. Hyperorality and dietary changes. b. Prominent decline in social cognition and/or executive abilities. 2. Language variant: a. Prominent decline in language ability, in the form of speech production, word finding, object naming, gram- mar, or word comprehension. D. Relative sparing of learning and memory and perceptual-motor function. E. The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular dis- ease, another neurodegenerative disease, the effects of a sub- stance, or another mental, neurological, or systemic disorder. Probable frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder is diagnosed if either of the following is present; otherwise, possible frontotempo- ral neurocognitive disorder should be diagnosed: 1. Evidence of a causative frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder genetic mutation, from either family history or genetic testing. 2. Evidence of disproportionate frontal and/or temporal lobe in- volvement from neuroimaging. Possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder is diagnosed if there is no evidence of a genetic mutation, and neuroimaging has not been performed. Coding note: For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with behavioral disturbance, code first 331.19 (G31.09) frontotemporal disease, followed by 294.11 (F02.81) probable major neurocognitive disorder due to fron- totemporal lobar degeneration, with behavioral disturbance. For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, without behavioral disturbance, code first 331.19 (G31.09) frontotemporal disease, followed by 294.10 (F02.80) prob- able major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar de- generation, without behavioral disturbance. For possible major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lo- bar degeneration, code 331.9 (G31.9) possible major neurocognitive 308 Neurocognitive Disorders disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration. (Note: Do not use the additional code for frontotemporal disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) For mild neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar de- generation, code 331.83 (G31.84). (Note: Do not use the additional code for frontotemporal disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder With Lewy Bodies A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder. B. The disorder has an insidious onset and gradual progression. C. The disorder meets a combination of core diagnostic features and suggestive diagnostic features for either probable or possi- ble neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies. For probable major or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies, the individual has two core features, or one sug- gestive feature with one or more core features. For possible ma- jor or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies, the individual has only one core feature, or one or more suggestive features. 1. Core diagnostic features: a. Fluctuating cognition with pronounced variations in at- tention and alertness. b. Recurrent visual hallucinations that are well formed and detailed. c. Spontaneous features of parkinsonism, with onset sub- sequent to the development of cognitive decline. 2. Suggestive diagnostic features: a. Meets criteria for rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. b. Severe neuroleptic sensitivity. D. The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular dis- ease, another neurodegenerative disease, the effects of a sub- stance, or another mental, neurological, or systemic disorder.",
