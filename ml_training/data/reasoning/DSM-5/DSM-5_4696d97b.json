  "text": "Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders Schizotypal (Personality) Disorder Criteria for schizotypal personality disorder can be found in the chapter “Personality Disorders.” Because this disorder is considered part of the schizophrenia spectrum of disorders, and is labeled in this section of ICD-9 and ICD-10 as schizotypal disorder, it is listed in this chapter, and the criteria are presented in the chapter “Personality Disorders.” Delusional Disorder 297.1 (F22) A. The presence of one (or more) delusions with a duration of 1 month or longer. B. Criterion A for schizophrenia has never been met. Note: Hallucinations, if present, are not prominent and are related to the delusional theme (e.g., the sensation of being infested with insects associated with delusions of infestation). C. Apart from the impact of the delusion(s) or its ramifications, func- tioning is not markedly impaired, and behavior is not obviously bi- zarre or odd. D. If manic or major depressive episodes have occurred, these have been brief relative to the duration of the delusional periods. E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition and is not better ex- plained by another mental disorder, such as body dysmorphic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Specify whether: Erotomanic type: This subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion is that another person is in love with the individual. 45 46 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders Grandiose type: This subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion is the conviction of having some great (but unrecog- nized) talent or insight or having made some important discovery. Jealous type: This subtype applies when the central theme of the individual’s delusion is that his or her spouse or lover is unfaithful. Persecutory type: This subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion involves the individual’s belief that he or she is be- ing conspired against, cheated, spied on, followed, poisoned or drugged, maliciously maligned, harassed, or obstructed in the pursuit of long-term goals. Somatic type: This subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion involves bodily functions or sensations. Mixed type: This subtype applies when no one delusional theme predominates. Unspecified type: This subtype applies when the dominant de- lusional belief cannot be clearly determined or is not described in the specific types (e.g., referential delusions without a prominent persecutory or grandiose component). Specify if: With bizarre content: Delusions are deemed bizarre if they are clearly implausible, not understandable, and not derived from or- dinary life experiences (e.g., an individual’s belief that a stranger has removed his or her internal organs and replaced them with someone else’s organs without leaving any wounds or scars). Specify if: The following course specifiers are only to be used after a 1-year du- ration of the disorder: First episode, currently in acute episode: First manifestation of the disorder meeting the defining diagnostic symptom and time criteria. An acute episode is a time period in which the symptom criteria are fulfilled. First episode, currently in partial remission: Partial remission is a time period during which an improvement after a previous episode is maintained and in which the defining criteria of the dis- order are only partially fulfilled. Brief Psychotic Disorder 47 First episode, currently in full remission: Full remission is a period of time after a previous episode during which no disorder- specific symptoms are present. Multiple episodes, currently in acute episode Multiple episodes, currently in partial remission Multiple episodes, currently in full remission Continuous: Symptoms fulfilling the diagnostic symptom criteria of the disorder are remaining for the majority of the illness course, with subthreshold symptom periods being very brief rel- ative to the overall course. Unspecified Specify current severity: Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms of psychosis, including delusions, hallucinations, disor- ganized speech, abnormal psychomotor behavior, and negative symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be rated for its current severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician- Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity in the chapter “Assessment Measures” in Section III of DSM-5.) Note: Diagnosis of delusional disorder can be made without us- ing this severity specifier. Brief Psychotic Disorder 298.8 (F23) A. Presence of one (or more) of the following symptoms. At least one of these must be (1), (2), or (3): 1. Delusions. 2. Hallucinations. 3. Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoher- ence). 4. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior. Note: Do not include a symptom if it is a culturally sanctioned re- sponse.",
