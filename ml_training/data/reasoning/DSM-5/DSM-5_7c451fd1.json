Binge-eating disorder (of low frequency and/or limited dura- tion): All of the criteria for binge-eating disorder are met, except that the binge eating occurs, on average, less than once a week and/or for less than 3 months. 4. Purging disorder: Recurrent purging behavior to influence weight or shape (e.g., self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications) in the absence of binge eating. 5. Night eating syndrome: Recurrent episodes of night eating, as manifested by eating after awakening from sleep or by excessive food consumption after the evening meal. There is awareness and recall of the eating. The night eating is not better explained by ex- ternal influences such as changes in the individual’s sleep-wake cycle or by local social norms. The night eating causes significant distress and/or impairment in functioning. The disordered pattern of eating is not better explained by binge-eating disorder or an- other mental disorder, including substance use, and is not attribut- able to another medical disorder or to an effect of medication. Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder 307.50 (F50.9) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character- istic of a feeding and eating disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important ar- eas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the feeding and eating disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified feeding or eating disorder category is used in situa- tions in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific feeding and eating disorder, and in- cludes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings). Elimination Disorders Enuresis 307.6 (F98.0) A. Repeated voiding of urine into bed or clothes, whether involun- tary or intentional. B. The behavior is clinically significant as manifested by either a fre- quency of at least twice a week for at least 3 consecutive months or the presence of clinically significant distress or impairment in social, academic (occupational), or other important areas of functioning. C. Chronological age is at least 5 years (or equivalent developmen- tal level). D. The behavior is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a diuretic, an antipsychotic medication) or an- other medical condition (e.g., diabetes, spina bifida, a seizure disorder). Specify whether: Nocturnal only: Passage of urine only during nighttime sleep. Diurnal only: Passage of urine during waking hours. Nocturnal and diurnal: A combination of the two subtypes above. 177 178 Elimination Disorders Encopresis 307.7 (F98.1) A. Repeated passage of feces into inappropriate places (e.g., cloth- ing, floor), whether involuntary or intentional. B. At least one such event occurs each month for at least 3 months. C. Chronological age is at least 4 years (or equivalent developmen- tal level). D. The behavior is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., laxatives) or another medical condition except through a mechanism involving constipation. Specify whether: With constipation and overflow incontinence: There is evi- dence of constipation on physical examination or by history. Without constipation and overflow incontinence: There is no evidence of constipation on physical examination or by history. Other Specified Elimination Disorder This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character- istic of an elimination disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the elimination disorders diagnostic class. The other specified elimination disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific elimination disorder. This is done by recording “other specified elimination disor- der” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “low-frequency enuresis”). Coding note: Code 788.39 (N39.498) for other specified elimination disorder with urinary symptoms; 787.60 (R15.9) for other specified elimination disorder with fecal symptoms.",
