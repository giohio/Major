The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder. B. There is insidious onset and gradual progression of impairment in one or more cognitive domains (for major neurocognitive dis- order, at least two domains must be impaired). C. Criteria are met for either probable or possible Alzheimer’s dis- ease as follows: For major neurocognitive disorder: Probable Alzheimer’s disease is diagnosed if either of the fol- lowing is present; otherwise, possible Alzheimer’s disease should be diagnosed. 1. Evidence of a causative Alzheimer’s disease genetic muta- tion from family history or genetic testing. 2. All three of the following are present: a. Clear evidence of decline in memory and learning and at least one other cognitive domain (based on detailed his- tory or serial neuropsychological testing). b. Steadily progressive, gradual decline in cognition, with- out extended plateaus. c. No evidence of mixed etiology (i.e., absence of other neurodegenerative or cerebrovascular disease, or an- other neurological, mental, or systemic disease or con- dition likely contributing to cognitive decline). For mild neurocognitive disorder: Probable Alzheimer’s disease is diagnosed if there is evidence of a causative Alzheimer’s disease genetic mutation from either genetic testing or family history. Possible Alzheimer’s disease is diagnosed if there is no evi- dence of a causative Alzheimer’s disease genetic mutation from either genetic testing or family history, and all three of the follow- ing are present: 1. Clear evidence of decline in memory and learning. 2. Steadily progressive, gradual decline in cognition, without extended plateaus. 306 Neurocognitive Disorders 3. No evidence of mixed etiology (i.e., absence of other neuro- degenerative or cerebrovascular disease, or another neuro- logical or systemic disease or condition likely contributing to cognitive decline). D. The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular dis- ease, another neurodegenerative disease, the effects of a sub- stance, or another mental, neurological, or systemic disorder. Coding note: For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to Alz- heimer’s disease, with behavioral disturbance, code first 331.0 (G30.9) Alzheimer’s disease, followed by 294.11 (F02.81) major neu- rocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease. For probable neuro- cognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease, without behavioral disturbance, code first 331.0 (G30.9) Alzheimer’s disease, followed by 294.10 (F02.80) major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease, without behavioral disturbance. For possible major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s dis- ease, code 331.9 (G31.9) possible major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease. (Note: Do not use the additional code for Alzheimer’s disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) For mild neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease, code 331.83 (G31.84). (Note: Do not use the additional code for Alzheim- er’s disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) Major or Mild Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder. B. The disturbance has insidious onset and gradual progression. C. Either (1) or (2): 1. Behavioral variant: a. Three or more of the following behavioral symptoms: i. Behavioral disinhibition. ii. Apathy or inertia. iii. Loss of sympathy or empathy.",
