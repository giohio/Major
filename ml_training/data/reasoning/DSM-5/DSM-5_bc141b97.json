  "text": "Conduct Disorder 223 312.82 (F91.2) Adolescent-onset type: Individuals show no symptom characteristic of conduct disorder prior to age 10 years. 312.89 (F91.9) Unspecified onset: Criteria for a diagnosis of conduct disorder are met, but there is not enough information available to determine whether the onset of the first symptom was before or after age 10 years. Specify if: With limited prosocial emotions: To qualify for this specifier, an individual must have displayed at least two of the following char- acteristics persistently over at least 12 months and in multiple relationships and settings. These characteristics reflect the indi- vidual’s typical pattern of interpersonal and emotional functioning over this period and not just occasional occurrences in some sit- uations. Thus, to assess the criteria for the specifier, multiple in- formation sources are necessary. In addition to the individual’s self-report, it is necessary to consider reports by others who have known the individual for extended periods of time (e.g., parents, teachers, co-workers, extended family members, peers). Lack of remorse or guilt: Does not feel bad or guilty when he or she does something wrong (exclude remorse when ex- pressed only when caught and/or facing punishment). The individual shows a general lack of concern about the nega- tive consequences of his or her actions. For example, the in- dividual is not remorseful after hurting someone or does not care about the consequences of breaking rules. Callous—lack of empathy: Disregards and is unconcerned about the feelings of others. The individual is described as cold and uncaring. The person appears more concerned about the effects of his or her actions on himself or herself, rather than their effects on others, even when they result in substantial harm to others. Unconcerned about performance: Does not show concern about poor/problematic performance at school, at work, or in other important activities. The individual does not put forth the effort necessary to perform well, even when expectations are clear, and typically blames others for his or her poor per- formance. 224 Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders Shallow or deficient affect: Does not express feelings or show emotions to others, except in ways that seem shallow, insincere, or superficial (e.g., actions contradict the emotion displayed; can turn emotions “on” or “off” quickly) or when emotional expressions are used for gain (e.g., emotions dis- played to manipulate or intimidate others). Specify current severity: Mild: Few if any conduct problems in excess of those required to make the diagnosis are present, and conduct problems cause relatively minor harm to others (e.g., lying, truancy, staying out after dark without permission, other rule breaking). Moderate: The number of conduct problems and the effect on oth- ers are intermediate between those specified in “mild” and those in “severe” (e.g., stealing without confronting a victim, vandalism). Severe: Many conduct problems in excess of those required to make the diagnosis are present, or conduct problems cause consid- erable harm to others (e.g., forced sex, physical cruelty, use of a weapon, stealing while confronting a victim, breaking and entering). Antisocial Personality Disorder Criteria for antisocial personality disorder can be found in the chap- ter “Personality Disorders.” Because this disorder is closely con- nected to the spectrum of “externalizing” conduct disorders in this chapter, as well as to the disorders in the adjoining chapter “Sub- stance-Related and Addictive Disorders,” it is listed here, and the cri- teria are presented in the chapter “Personality Disorders.” Pyromania 312.33 (F63.1) A. Deliberate and purposeful fire setting on more than one occasion. B. Tension or affective arousal before the act. C. Fascination with, interest in, curiosity about, or attraction to fire and its situational contexts (e.g., paraphernalia, uses, conse- quences).",
