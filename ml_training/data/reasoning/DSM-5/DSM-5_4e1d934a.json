  "text": "Medication-Induced Movement Disorders 349 Neuroleptic malignant syndrome also must be distinguished from similar syndromes resulting from the use of other substances or medi- cations, such as serotonin syndrome; parkinsonian hyperthermia syn- drome following abrupt discontinuation of dopamine agonists; alcohol or sedative withdrawal; malignant hyperthermia occurring during anesthesia; hyperthermia associated with abuse of stimulants and hallu- cinogens; and atropine poisoning from anticholinergics. In rare instances, individuals with schizophrenia or a mood disor- der may present with malignant catatonia, which may be indistin- guishable from neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Some investigators consider neuroleptic malignant syndrome to be a drug-induced form of malignant catatonia. Medication-Induced Acute Dystonia 333.72 (G24.02) Medication-Induced Acute Dystonia Abnormal and prolonged contraction of the muscles of the eyes (oc- ulogyric crisis), head, neck (torticollis or retrocollis), limbs, or trunk developing within a few days of starting or raising the dosage of a medication (such as a neuroleptic) or after reducing the dosage of a medication used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms. Medication-Induced Acute Akathisia 333.99 (G25.71) Medication-Induced Acute Akathisia Subjective complaints of restlessness, often accompanied by ob- served excessive movements (e.g., fidgety movements of the legs, rocking from foot to foot, pacing, inability to sit or stand still), devel- oping within a few weeks of starting or raising the dosage of a med- ication (such as a neuroleptic) or after reducing the dosage of a medication used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms. Tardive Dyskinesia 333.85 (G24.01) Tardive Dyskinesia Involuntary athetoid or choreiform movements (lasting at least a few weeks) generally of the tongue, lower face and jaw, and extremities (but sometimes involving the pharyngeal, diaphragmatic, or trunk 350 Medication-Induced Movement Disorders muscles) developing in association with the use of a neuroleptic med- ication for at least a few months. Symptoms may develop after a shorter period of medication use in older persons. In some patients, movements of this type may appear after discontinuation, or after change or reduction in dosage, of neuro- leptic medications, in which case the condition is called neuroleptic with- drawal-emergent dyskinesia. Because withdrawal-emergent dyskinesia is usually time-limited, lasting less than 4–8 weeks, dyskinesia that per- sists beyond this window is considered to be tardive dyskinesia. Tardive Dystonia Tardive Akathisia 333.72 (G24.09) Tardive Dystonia 333.99 (G25.71) Tardive Akathisia Tardive syndrome involving other types of movement problems, such as dystonia or akathisia, which are distinguished by their late emergence in the course of treatment and their potential persistence for months to years, even in the face of neuroleptic discontinuation or dosage reduction. Medication-Induced Postural Tremor 333.1 (G25.1) Medication-Induced Postural Tremor Fine tremor (usually in the range of 8–12 Hz) occurring during at- tempts to maintain a posture and developing in association with the use of medication (e.g., lithium, antidepressants, valproate). This tremor is very similar to the tremor seen with anxiety, caffeine, and other stimulants. Other Medication-Induced Movement Disorder 333.99 (G25.79) Other Medication-Induced Movement Disorder This category is for medication-induced movement disorders not captured by any of the specific disorders listed above. Examples in- clude 1) presentations resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome that are associated with medications other than neuroleptics and 2)other medication-induced tardive conditions. Medication-Induced Movement Disorders 351 Antidepressant Discontinuation Syndrome 995.29 (T43.205A) Initial encounter 995.29 (T43.205D) Subsequent encounter 995.29 (T43.205S) Sequelae Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is a set of symptoms that can occur after an abrupt cessation (or marked reduction in dose) of an anti- depressant medication that was taken continuously for at least 1 month. Symptoms generally begin within 2–4 days and typically include specif- ic sensory, somatic, and cognitive-emotional manifestations. Frequently reported sensory and somatic symptoms include flashes of lights, “electric shock” sensations, nausea, and hyperresponsivity to noises or lights. Nonspecific anxiety and feelings of dread may also be report- ed. Symptoms are alleviated by restarting the same medication or starting a different medication that has a similar mechanism of action— for example, discontinuation symptoms after withdrawal from a sero- tonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor may be alleviated by starting a tricyclic antidepressant. To qualify as antidepressant discontinuation syndrome, the symptoms should not have been present before the anti- depressant dosage was reduced and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., manic or hypomanic episode, substance intoxica- tion, substance withdrawal, somatic symptom disorder). Diagnostic Features Discontinuation symptoms may occur following treatment with tri- cyclic antidepressants (e.g., imipramine, amitriptyline, desipra- mine), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., phenelzine, selegiline, pargyline). The incidence of this syndrome depends on the dosage and half-life of the medication being taken, as well as the rate at which the medication is tapered. Short-acting medications that are stopped abruptly rather than tapered gradually may pose the greatest risk. The short-acting selective serotonin reuptake in- hibitor (SSRI) paroxetine is the agent most commonly associated with discontinuation symptoms, but such symptoms occur for all types of antidepressants. Unlike withdrawal syndromes associated with opioids, alcohol, and other substances of abuse, antidepressant discontinuation syn- 352 Medication-Induced Movement Disorders drome has no pathognomonic symptoms. Instead, the symptoms tend to be vague and variable and typically begin 2–4 days after the last dose of the antidepressant. For SSRIs (e.g., paroxetine), symptoms such as dizziness, ringing in the ears, “electric shocks in the head,” an inability to sleep, and acute anxiety are described. The antidepressant use prior to discontinuation must not have incurred hypomania or euphoria (i.e., there should be confidence that the discontinuation syndrome is not the result of fluctuations in mood stability associated with the previous treatment). The antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is based solely on pharmacological factors and is not related to the reinforcing ef- fects of an antidepressant. Also, in the case of stimulant augmentation of an antidepressant, abrupt cessation may result in stimulant withdrawal symptoms (see “Stimulant Withdrawal” in the chapter “Substance- Related and Addictive Disorders”) rather than the antidepressant dis- continuation syndrome described here. Prevalence The prevalence of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is un- known but is thought to vary according to the dosage prior to dis- continuation, the half-life and receptor-binding affinity of the medication, and possibly the individual’s genetically influenced rate of metabolism for this medication. Course and Development Because longitudinal studies are lacking, little is known about the clinical course of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome. Symp- toms appear to abate over time with very gradual dosage reductions. After an episode, some individuals may prefer to resume medication indefinitely if tolerated. Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis of antidepressant discontinuation syn- drome includes anxiety and depressive disorders, substance use dis- orders, and tolerance to medications. Anxiety and depressive disorders. Discontinuation symptoms of- ten resemble symptoms of a persistent anxiety disorder or a return of somatic symptoms of depression for which the medication was ini- tially given.",
