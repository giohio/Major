Persistent difficulties in the acquisition and use of language across modalities (i.e., spoken, written, sign language, or other) due to deficits in comprehension or production that include the following: 1. Reduced vocabulary (word knowledge and use). 2. Limited sentence structure (ability to put words and word end- ings together to form sentences based on the rules of gram- mar and morphology). 3. Impairments in discourse (ability to use vocabulary and con- nect sentences to explain or describe a topic or series of events or have a conversation). B. Language abilities are substantially and quantifiably below those expected for age, resulting in functional limitations in effective communication, social participation, academic achievement, or occupational performance, individually or in any combination. C. Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period. D. The difficulties are not attributable to hearing or other sensory im- pairment, motor dysfunction, or another medical or neurological condition and are not better explained by intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) or global developmental delay. Speech Sound Disorder 315.39 (F80.0) A. Persistent difficulty with speech sound production that interferes with speech intelligibility or prevents verbal communication of messages. Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering) 25 B. The disturbance causes limitations in effective communication that interfere with social participation, academic achievement, or occupational performance, individually or in any combination. C. Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period. D. The difficulties are not attributable to congenital or acquired condi- tions, such as cerebral palsy, cleft palate, deafness or hearing loss, traumatic brain injury, or other medical or neurological conditions. Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering) 315.35 (F80.81) A. Disturbances in the normal fluency and time patterning of speech that are inappropriate for the individual’s age and language skills, persist over time, and are characterized by frequent and marked occurrences of one (or more) of the following: 1. Sound and syllable repetitions. 2. Sound prolongations of consonants as well as vowels. 3. Broken words (e.g., pauses within a word). 4. Audible or silent blocking (filled or unfilled pauses in speech). 5. Circumlocutions (word substitutions to avoid problematic words). 6. Words produced with an excess of physical tension. 7. Monosyllabic whole-word repetitions (e.g., “I-I-I-I see him”). B. The disturbance causes anxiety about speaking or limitations in effective communication, social participation, or academic or oc- cupational performance, individually or in any combination. C. The onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period. (Note: Later-onset cases are diagnosed as 307.0 [F98.5] adult- onset fluency disorder.) D. The disturbance is not attributable to a speech-motor or sensory deficit, dysfluency associated with neurological insult (e.g., stroke, tumor, trauma), or another medical condition and is not better ex- plained by another mental disorder.",
