  "text": "Other (or Unknown) Substance Withdrawal 281 E. The substance involved cannot be classified under any of the other substance categories (alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics; stimulants; or tobacco) or is unknown. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.0. The ICD-10-CM code for other (or unknown) substance withdrawal is F19.239. Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates the comorbid presence of a moderate or severe other (or unknown) substance use disorder. It is not permis- sible to code a comorbid mild other (or unknown) substance use dis- order with other (or unknown) substance withdrawal. Other (or Unknown) Substance–Induced Disorders Because the category of other or unknown substances is inherently ill- defined, the extent and range of induced disorders are uncertain. Nevertheless, other (or unknown) substance–induced disorders are possible and are described in other chapters of the book with disor- ders with which they share phenomenology (see the substance/med- ication-induced mental disorders in these chapters): other (or unknown) substance–induced psychotic disorder (“Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders”); other (or unknown) sub- stance–induced bipolar disorder (“Bipolar and Related Disorders”); other (or unknown) substance–induced depressive disorder (“De- pressive Disorders”); other (or unknown) substance–induced anxiety disorders (“Anxiety Disorders”); other (or unknown) substance– induced obsessive-compulsive disorder (“Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders”); other (or unknown) substance–induced sleep disorder (“Sleep-Wake Disorders”); other (or unknown) sub- stance–induced sexual dysfunction (“Sexual Dysfunctions”); and other (or unknown) substance/medication–induced major or mild neu- rocognitive disorder (“Neurocognitive Disorders”). For other (or unknown) substance–induced intoxication delirium and other (or un- known) substance–induced withdrawal delirium, see the criteria and discussion of delirium in the chapter “Neurocognitive Disorders.” These other (or unknown) substance–induced disorders are diag- 282 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders nosed instead of other (or unknown) substance intoxication or other (or unknown) substance withdrawal only when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention. Unspecified Other (or Unknown) Substance–Related Disorder 292.9 (F19.99) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character- istic of an other (or unknown) substance–related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any specific other (or unknown) substance–related dis- order or any of the disorders in the substance-related disorders diag- nostic class. Non-Substance-Related Disorders Gambling Disorder 312.31 (F63.0) A. Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more) of the following in a 12-month period: 1. Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement. 2. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. 3. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling. Gambling Disorder 283 4. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handi- capping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble). 5. Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed). 6. After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (“chasing” one’s losses). 7. Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling. 8. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or ed- ucational or career opportunity because of gambling. 9. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate finan- cial situations caused by gambling. B. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic epi- sode. Specify if: Episodic: Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months. Persistent: Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diag- nostic criteria for multiple years. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months. In sustained remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of 12 months or longer. Specify current severity: Mild: 4–5 criteria met. Moderate: 6–7 criteria met. Severe: 8–9 criteria met.",
