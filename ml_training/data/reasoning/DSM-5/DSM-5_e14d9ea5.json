  "text": "Stimulant Intoxication 271 Specify the specific intoxicant (i.e., amphetamine-type substance, cocaine, or other stimulant). Specify if: With perceptual disturbances: This specifier may be noted when hallucinations with intact reality testing or auditory, visual, or tactile illusions occur in the absence of a delirium. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.89. The ICD-10-CM code depends on whether the stimulant is an amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant; whether there is a comorbid amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant use disorder; and whether or not there are percep- tual disturbances. For amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant intoxication, without perceptual disturbances: If a mild amphetamine or other stimulant use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F15.129, and if a moderate or severe amphetamine or other stimulant use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F15.229. If there is no comorbid amphetamine or other stimulant use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F15.929. Similarly, if a mild cocaine use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F14.129, and if a moderate or severe cocaine use disorder is co- morbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F14.229. If there is no comorbid cocaine use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F14.929. For amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant intoxication, with perceptual disturbances: If a mild amphetamine or other stimulant use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F15.122, and if a moderate or severe amphetamine or other stimulant use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F15.222. If there is no comorbid amphetamine or other stimulant use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F15.922. Similarly, if a mild cocaine use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F14.122, and if a moderate or severe cocaine use disorder is co- morbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F14.222. If there is no comorbid cocaine use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F14.922. 272 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders Stimulant Withdrawal A. Cessation of (or reduction in) prolonged amphetamine-type sub- stance, cocaine, or other stimulant use. B. Dysphoric mood and two (or more) of the following physiological changes, developing within a few hours to several days after Cri- terion A: 1. Fatigue. 2. Vivid, unpleasant dreams. 3. Insomnia or hypersomnia. 4. Increased appetite. 5. Psychomotor retardation or agitation. C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disor- der, including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance. Specify the specific substance that causes the withdrawal syn- drome (i.e., amphetamine-type substance, cocaine, or other stimulant). Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.0. The ICD-10-CM code depends on whether the stimulant is an amphetamine, cocaine, or another stimulant. The ICD-10-CM code for amphetamine or other stimulant withdrawal is F15.23, and the ICD-10-CM for cocaine with- drawal is F14.23. Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates the comor- bid presence of a moderate or severe amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant use disorder, reflecting the fact that amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant withdrawal can only occur in the presence of a moderate or severe amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant use disorder. It is not permissible to code a comorbid mild amphet- amine, cocaine, or other stimulant use disorder with amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant withdrawal.",
