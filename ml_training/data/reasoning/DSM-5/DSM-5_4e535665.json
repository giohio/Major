Coding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medication]-induced neurocognitive disorders are indicat- ed in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced neurocognitive disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced neurocogni- tive disorder (e.g., “mild inhalant use disorder with inhalant-induced major neurocognitive disorder”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced neurocognitive disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should re- cord “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder, then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the sub- stance-induced neurocognitive disorder. For some classes of sub- stances (i.e., alcohol; sedatives, hypnotics, anxiolytics), it is not permissible to code a comorbid mild substance use disorder with a substance-induced neurocognitive disorder; only a comorbid moder- ate or severe substance use disorder, or no substance use disorder, can be diagnosed. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.

The name of the substance/medication-induced neu- rocognitive disorder begins with the specific substance/medication (e.g., alcohol) that is presumed to be causing the neurocognitive symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes, the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used. The name of the disorder (i.e., [specific substance]-induced major neurocognitive disorder or [specific substance]-induced mild neuro- cognitive disorder) is followed by the type in the case of alcohol (i.e., nonamnestic-confabulatory type, amnestic-confabulatory type), fol- lowed by specification of duration (i.e., persistent). Unlike the re- cording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the substance/ medication-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a sin- gle code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of persistent amnes- tic-confabulatory symptoms in a man with a severe alcohol use dis- order, the diagnosis is 291.1 alcohol-induced major neurocognitive disorder, amnestic-confabulatory type, persistent. An additional di- agnosis of 303.90 severe alcohol use disorder is also given. If the sub- stance/medication-induced neurocognitive disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a sporadic heavy use of inhalants), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., 292.82 inhalant-induced mild neurocognitive disorder). ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced neu- rocognitive disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., alcohol) that is presumed to be causing the neurocognitive symptoms. The di- agnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comor- bid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes, the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown sub- stance” should be used.",
