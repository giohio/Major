The name of the substance/medication-induced anxi- ety disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, salbu- tamol) that is presumed to be causing the anxiety symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., salbutamol), the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used. The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal, onset during medication use). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use dis- order into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of anxiety symptoms occurring during withdrawal in a man with a severe loraze- pam use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.89 lorazepam-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during withdrawal. An additional diagnosis of 304.10 severe lorazepam use disorder is also given. When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of anx- iety symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., 292.89 methylphe- nidate-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during intoxication; 292.89 salbutamol-induced anxiety disorder, with onset after medication use). ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced anx- iety disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, salbu- tamol) that is presumed to be causing the anxiety symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a co- morbid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., salbutamol), the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used. When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word “with,” fol- lowed by the name of the substance-induced anxiety disorder, followed Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition 127 by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset dur- ing withdrawal, onset during medication use). For example, in the case of anxiety symptoms occurring during withdrawal in a man with a se- vere lorazepam use disorder, the diagnosis is F13.280 severe loraze- pam use disorder with lorazepam-induced anxiety disorder, with on- set during withdrawal. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe lorazepam use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced anxiety disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F16.980 psilocybin-induced anxiety disor- der, with onset during intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of anxiety symp- toms, each should be listed separately (e.g., F15.280 severe methylphe- nidate use disorder with methylphenidate-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during intoxication; F19.980 salbutamol-induced anxiety disorder, with onset after medication use). Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition 293.84 (F06.4) A. Panic attacks or anxiety is predominant in the clinical picture. B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or lab- oratory findings that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiolog- ical consequence of another medical condition. C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental dis- order. D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Coding note: Include the name of the other medical condition within the name of the mental disorder (e.g., 293.84 [F06.4] anxiety disor- der due to pheochromocytoma). The other medical condition should be coded and listed separately immediately before the anxiety disor- der due to the medical condition (e.g., 227.0 [D35.00] pheochromo- cytoma; 293.84 [F06.4] anxiety disorder due to pheochromocytoma. 128 Anxiety Disorders Other Specified Anxiety Disorder 300.09 (F41.8) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an anxiety disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impair- ment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning pre- dominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the anxiety disorders diagnostic class. The other specified anxiety disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to commu- nicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the crite- ria for any specific anxiety disorder. This is done by recording “other specified anxiety disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “gener- alized anxiety not occurring more days than not”). Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation include the following: 1. Limited-symptom attacks 2. Generalized anxiety not occurring more days than not 3. Khyâl cap (wind attacks): See “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress” in the Appendix to DSM-5. 4. Ataque de nervios (attack of nerves): See “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress” in the Appendix to DSM-5. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder 300.00 (F41.9) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character- istic of an anxiety disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of func- tioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the dis- orders in the anxiety disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified anxiety disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific anxiety disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insuffi- cient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emer- gency room settings).",
