  "text": "314 Neurocognitive Disorders Recording Procedures ICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced neu- rocognitive disorder begins with the specific substance/medication (e.g., alcohol) that is presumed to be causing the neurocognitive symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes, the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used. The name of the disorder (i.e., [specific substance]-induced major neurocognitive disorder or [specific substance]-induced mild neuro- cognitive disorder) is followed by the type in the case of alcohol (i.e., nonamnestic-confabulatory type, amnestic-confabulatory type), fol- lowed by specification of duration (i.e., persistent). Unlike the re- cording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the substance/ medication-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a sin- gle code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of persistent amnes- tic-confabulatory symptoms in a man with a severe alcohol use dis- order, the diagnosis is 291.1 alcohol-induced major neurocognitive disorder, amnestic-confabulatory type, persistent. An additional di- agnosis of 303.90 severe alcohol use disorder is also given. If the sub- stance/medication-induced neurocognitive disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a sporadic heavy use of inhalants), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., 292.82 inhalant-induced mild neurocognitive disorder). ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced neu- rocognitive disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., alcohol) that is presumed to be causing the neurocognitive symptoms. The di- agnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comor- bid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes, the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown sub- stance” should be used. Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to HIV Infection 315 When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word “with,” fol- lowed by the name of the disorder (i.e., [specific substance]-induced major neurocognitive disorder or [specific substance]-induced mild neurocognitive disorder), followed by the type in the case of alcohol (i.e., nonamnestic-confabulatory type, amnestic-confabulatory type), followed by specification of duration (i.e., persistent). For example, in the case of persistent amnestic-confabulatory symptoms in a man with a severe alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis is F10.26 severe al- cohol use disorder with alcohol-induced major neurocognitive disor- der, amnestic-confabulatory type, persistent. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe alcohol use disorder is not given. If the substance- induced neurocognitive disorder occurs without a comorbid sub- stance use disorder (e.g., after a sporadic heavy use of inhalants), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F18.988 inhal- ant-induced mild neurocognitive disorder). Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to HIV Infection A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder. B. There is documented infection with human immunodeficiency vi- rus (HIV). C. The neurocognitive disorder is not better explained by non-HIV conditions, including secondary brain diseases such as progres- sive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or cryptococcal meningitis. D. The neurocognitive disorder is not attributable to another medi- cal condition and is not better explained by a mental disorder. Coding note: For major neurocognitive disorder due to HIV infection, with behavioral disturbance, code first 042 (B20) HIV infection, fol- lowed by 294.11 (F02.81) major neurocognitive disorder due to HIV in- fection, with behavioral disturbance. For major neurocognitive disorder due to HIV infection, without behavioral disturbance, code first 042 (B20) HIV infection, followed by 294.10 (F02.80) major neurocognitive disorder due to HIV infection, without behavioral disturbance.",
