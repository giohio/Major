  "text": "224 Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders Shallow or deficient affect: Does not express feelings or show emotions to others, except in ways that seem shallow, insincere, or superficial (e.g., actions contradict the emotion displayed; can turn emotions “on” or “off” quickly) or when emotional expressions are used for gain (e.g., emotions dis- played to manipulate or intimidate others). Specify current severity: Mild: Few if any conduct problems in excess of those required to make the diagnosis are present, and conduct problems cause relatively minor harm to others (e.g., lying, truancy, staying out after dark without permission, other rule breaking). Moderate: The number of conduct problems and the effect on oth- ers are intermediate between those specified in “mild” and those in “severe” (e.g., stealing without confronting a victim, vandalism). Severe: Many conduct problems in excess of those required to make the diagnosis are present, or conduct problems cause consid- erable harm to others (e.g., forced sex, physical cruelty, use of a weapon, stealing while confronting a victim, breaking and entering). Antisocial Personality Disorder Criteria for antisocial personality disorder can be found in the chap- ter “Personality Disorders.” Because this disorder is closely con- nected to the spectrum of “externalizing” conduct disorders in this chapter, as well as to the disorders in the adjoining chapter “Sub- stance-Related and Addictive Disorders,” it is listed here, and the cri- teria are presented in the chapter “Personality Disorders.” Pyromania 312.33 (F63.1) A. Deliberate and purposeful fire setting on more than one occasion. B. Tension or affective arousal before the act. C. Fascination with, interest in, curiosity about, or attraction to fire and its situational contexts (e.g., paraphernalia, uses, conse- quences). Kleptomania 225 D. Pleasure, gratification, or relief when setting fires or when wit- nessing or participating in their aftermath. E. The fire setting is not done for monetary gain, as an expression of sociopolitical ideology, to conceal criminal activity, to express anger or vengeance, to improve one’s living circumstances, in response to a delusion or hallucination, or as a result of impaired judgment (e.g., in major neurocognitive disorder, intellectual disability [intel- lectual developmental disorder], substance intoxication). F. The fire setting is not better explained by conduct disorder, a manic episode, or antisocial personality disorder. Kleptomania 312.32 (F63.2) A. Recurrent failure to resist impulses to steal objects that are not needed for personal use or for their monetary value. B. Increasing sense of tension immediately before committing the theft. C. Pleasure, gratification, or relief at the time of committing the theft. D. The stealing is not committed to express anger or vengeance and is not in response to a delusion or a hallucination. E. The stealing is not better explained by conduct disorder, a manic episode, or antisocial personality disorder. Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder 312.89 (F91.8) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character- istic of a disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders diagnostic class. The other specified disrup- tive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder category is used in situa- 226 Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders tions in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any spe- cific disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder. This is done by recording “other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and con- duct disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “recurrent behav- ioral outbursts of insufficient frequency”). Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder 312.9 (F91.9) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character- istic of a disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the crite- ria are not met for a specific disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient in- formation to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).",
