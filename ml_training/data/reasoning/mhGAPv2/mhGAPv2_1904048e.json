Stigma A distinguishing mark establishing a demarcation between the stigmatized person and others attributing negative characteristics to this person. The stigma attached to mental illness often leads to social exclusion and discrimination and creates an additional burden for the affected individual. Stroke See cerebrovascular accident (CVA). Mental, neurological and substance use (MNS) disorders are highly prevalent, accounting for a substantial burden of disease and disability globally. In order to bridge the gap between available resources and the significant need for services, the World Health Organization launched the Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP). The objective of mhGAP is to scale-up care and services using evidence-based interventions for prevention and management of priority MNS conditions. The mhGAP Intervention Guide version 1.0 for MNS disorders for non-specialist health settings was developed in 2010 as a simple technical tool to allow for integrated management of priority MNS conditions using protocols for clinical decision-making. With uptake in over 90 countries, mhGAP-IG 1.0 version has had widespread success. It is our pleasure to present mhGAP version 2.0, with updates incorporating new evidence-based guidance, enhanced usability, and new sections to expand its use by both health care providers as well as programme managers. It is our hope that this guide will continue to provide the road-map to deliver care and services for people with MNS disorders around the world and lead us closer to achieving the goal of universal health coverage. The mhGAP-IG version 2.0 includes the following sections: E ssential Care & Practice M aster Chart Depression For more information, Psychoses please contact: Epilepsy Department of Mental Health and Child & Adolescent Mental & Behavioural Disorders Substance Abuse Dementia World Health Organization Avenue Appia 20 Disorders due to Substance Use CH-1211 Geneva 27 Self-harm / Suicide Switzerland Other Significant Mental Health Complaints Email: mhgap-info@who.int Implementation of mhGAP-IG Website: www.who.int/mental_health/mhgap",
