IF THE PERSON IS NOT IMPROVING ON CURRENT DOSE: » Review adherence to medications. » Consider increase in medication dose as needed to maximal dose if no adverse effects. » If response is still poor, – Consider switching medication. The new medication should be at an optimum dose before slowly discon- tinuing the first. » If response is still poor, – Review diagnosis. – REFER TO SPECIALIST. » Follow-up more frequently. CLINICAL TIP: » ADVERSE EFFECTS (e.g. drowsiness, nystagmus, diplopia, ataxia) are from too high doses of medication for the person. » If there is an IDIOSYNCRATIC REACTION (allergic reaction, bone marrow depression, hepatic failure), switch antiepileptic medication. EPILEPSY 67 68 EPI 3 EPILEPSY Follow-up 2 MONITOR TREATMENT At every contact: » » Evaluate side-effects of medication including adverse effects Does the patient have any new symptoms of concern? and idiosyncratic reactions (clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests Review for any new symptoms of depression and anxiety given when available). high risk of co-morbidity with epilepsy. » » Provide psychoeducation and review psychosocial interventions.

Only children and adolescents with a moderate to severe degree of psy- chological, social, educational or occupational impairment in multiple settings should be diagnosed as having behavioural disorders. 69 70 CMH CHILD & ADOLESCENT MENTAL & BEHAVIOURAL DISORDERS CMH Quick Overview ASSESSMENT MANAGEMENT A ssess for problems with development Management Protocols 1.
