Diseases of the genitourinary system This chapter includes a grouping of premenstrual disturbances that may include significant mood symptoms, such as depressed mood and irritability, as well as somatic and cognitive symptoms that may also occur in mood disorders. In particular, premenstrual dysphoric disorder is secondary-parented in the mood disorders grouping of ICD-11, and the CDDR for this entity are provided in this volume. In addition, while nearly all sexual dysfunctions classified as diseases of the genitourinary system in ICD-10 have been moved to the new ICD-11 chapter on conditions related to sexual health (see the next section), pain syndromes that are more generally associated with genital organs or the menstrual cycle are classified in Chapter 16. Chapter 17. Conditions related to sexual health Analogously to sleep-wake disorders, the ICD-10 classification of sexual dysfunctions was based on a Cartesian separation of “organic” and “nonorganic” conditions. Sexual dysfunctions not caused by organic disorder or disease (F52), which also include “nonorganic” versions of the sexual pain disorders vaginismus and dyspareunia, were classified in the ICD-10 chapter on mental and behavioural disorders, and most “organic” sexual dysfunctions are classified in the chapter on diseases of the genitourinary system. These have been brought together in a new unified classification of sexual dysfunctions and sexual pain disorders in the ICD-11 chapter on conditions related to sexual health. This approach is consistent with current, more integrative clinical approaches in sexual health, and recognizes the large body of evidence that the origin and maintenance of sexual dysfunctions and sexual pain disorders most often involves the interaction of physiological and psychological/behavioural factors. Reformulated versions of all sexual dysfunctions from the ICD-10 mental and behavioural disorders chapter can be found in the ICD-11 chapter on conditions related to sexual health, except for ICD-10 excessive sexual drive – a condition most closely related to compulsive sexual behaviour disorder in ICD-11 – which is included in the grouping of impulse control disorders. As with sleep-wake disorders, placement of these conditions in a separate chapter on conditions related to sexual health is not intended to indicate that they should not be diagnosed and treated by appropriately trained mental health professionals. The ICD-11 chapter on conditions related to sexual health also includes gender incongruence, which represents a reformulation and renaming of ICD-10 gender identity disorders. There was substantial evidence that the nexus of stigmatization of transgender people and of mental disorders had contributed to a doubly burdensome situation for transgender and gender-variant people, and that stigma associated with the intersection of transgender status and mental disorders had contributed to precarious legal status, human rights violations and barriers to appropriate health care in this population. Although gender identity is clearly distinct from sex, this chapter appeared to offer the most broadly acceptable home for categories related to gender identity, while making it clear that they are no longer considered to be mental disorders. This position has been supported by a series of ICD-11 field studies. Gender incongruence was not proposed for elimination in ICD-11 because in many countries access to relevant health services is contingent on a qualifying diagnosis. Chapter 21. Symptoms, signs or clinical findings, not elsewhere classified The categories in this chapter are not considered to be disorders but rather provide descriptions of specific symptoms that may be used to describe the reason for a clinical encounter when a more precise diagnosis has not been established for various reasons. These categories may also be used to describe clinically important aspects of the individual’s presentation when a diagnosis has been assigned. 30 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders A part of this chapter is a detailed and comprehensive listing of mental or behavioural symptoms, signs or clinical findings, which also includes definitions for each. These often represent important problems in their own right (e.g. avolition, demoralization, apathy, thought blocking). The categories from this section can be used to describe the clinical presentation in the absence of a definitive mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder diagnosis. In addition, these categories can be useful when a mental disorder diagnosis has been assigned, and the symptom being described has implications for treatment but is not an essential feature of the disorder itself and does not meet the diagnostic requirements for a co-occurring disorder. A listing of mental or behavioural symptoms, signs or clinical findings included in this chapter, with their definitions, is provided as part of the CDDR (p. 677). Chapter 24. Factors influencing health status or contact with health services Categories from this chapter may be used when a person seeks mental health services for a reason other than for symptoms of a mental disorder (e.g. counselling for a problem associated with unemployment), or when the problem influences the person’s health status but is not in itself a mental disorder. A number of categories in this chapter are relevant to mental health professionals because they: • represent a reason for a clinical encounter other than a mental disorder (e.g. counselling related to sexuality, counselling related to procreative management); • are a focus of intervention (e.g. relationship problems and maltreatment – see p. 707); • are important to consider in the differential diagnosis of mental disorders (e.g. uncomplicated bereavement, malingering); or • are factors that may significantly contribute to the initiation or maintenance of disorders in the mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders chapter, including recognized social determinants of mental health (i.e. problems associated with finances, problems associated with employment or unemployment, target of perceived adverse discrimination or persecution). A listing of factors influencing health status or contact with health services that are particularly relevant to mental health and mental health services is provided as part of the CDDR (p. 733). ICD-11 diagnostic coding Among the most important innovations of ICD-11 is its ability to capture much more clinical information associated with a particular diagnosis than was possible with ICD-10. Some of the ICD-11 coding features discussed in this section are designed for optimal use in the context of electronic information systems able to generate and interpret complex, multipart codes – for example, based on checklists completed by the health professional. However, some of these coding capabilities will also be useful to health professionals who are individually responsible for determining and recording diagnoses and diagnostic codes. Even when coding itself is done by professional coders, as in some countries and health systems, it is important for health professionals to understand the information needed to generate the most accurate and useful codes so that they are better able to provide this information as a part of the medical record, even if it is recorded by hand. ICD-10 codes contained a letter of the alphabet in the first position, which indicated the chapter in which the category was classified. (The codes for ICD-10 mental and behavioural disorders all began with the letter “F”.) This was sufficient for the 22 chapters in ICD-10. All the other characters in the ICD-10 codes were limited to numbers, which imposed a limit of 10 subdivisions Using the CDDR for ICD-11 mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders in clinical settings 31 at each level corresponding to each digit in the diagnostic code. Moreover, ICD-10 allowed for the coding of only limited disorder-specific clinical information within a diagnostic code via the provision of specifiers and subtypes that could be codified in the fourth, fifth or sixth characters in an ICD-10 code. ICD-11, like ICD-10 and its predecessors, also conveys diagnostic information based on the various positions and values of alphanumeric characters within a diagnostic code. The first character of an ICD-11 code indicates the top-level chapter; for example, if the first character is a “6”, the code is found in the mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders chapter. The second and third characters taken together indicate the diagnostic class or grouping (e.g. 6A7 for depressive disorders, 6B0 for anxiety and fear-related disorders). The fourth character typically indicates the specific disorder within that class (e.g. 6A70 for single episode depressive disorder, 6A71 for recurrent depressive disorder), but in cases in which these number more than 10, letters of the alphabet are used after the digits 0–9 are exhausted. For example, the fourth character in the ICD-11 codes for disorders due to substance use indicates the substance class. Because ICD-11 recognizes 14 different specific substance classes, the fourth character codes for the last four substance classes required resorting to letters (e.g. the code for disorders due to use of volatile inhalants is 6C4B.) The fifth character (following a decimal point) generally indicates subtypes or specifiers applicable to that diagnosis (e.g. 6A70.0 for single episode, mild; 6A70.1 for single episode, moderate, without psychotic symptoms; 6A70.2 for single episode, moderate, with psychotic symptoms). The ICD-11 codes for some disorders with more complicated systems for specifiers might require the use of a sixth character. For example, the fifth character for acute and transient psychotic disorder indicates whether it is the first episode (6A23.0) or one of multiple episodes (6A23.1). Indicating whether it is currently symptomatic or in remission requires a sixth character. That is, for 6A23.0 Acute and transient psychotic disorder, first episode, 6A23.00 is currently symptomatic; 6A23.01 is currently in partial remission; and 6A23.02 is currently in full remission. ICD-11 refers to this method of providing unique codes for all possible combinations of first or multiple episodes and currently symptomatic or partial remission or full remission for acute and transient psychotic disorder as “precoordination”. ICD-11 offers an additional coding convention that goes beyond just capturing clinical information within the confines of a single diagnostic code by allowing additional codes to be linked to the initial diagnostic code for the purpose of indicating additional clinically significant features. ICD-11 refers to this method of combining codes as “postcoordination”. One type of postcoordination used in the chapter on mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders involves appending codes that indicate specific symptomatic or course presentations that are applicable only to diagnoses within a particular diagnostic grouping. These include symptomatic manifestations of primary psychotic disorders; symptomatic and course presentations for mood episodes in mood disorders; prominent personality traits or patterns in personality disorders; and behavioural or psychological disturbances in dementia. For example, the diagnostic codes indicating symptomatic and course presentations for mood episodes applicable only to mood disorders include the following • 6A80.0 indicates the presence of prominent anxiety symptoms during a mood episode. • 6A80.1 indicates that two or more panic attacks have occurred during a mood episode. • 6A80.2 indicates that a current depressive episode is persistent. • 6A80.3 indicates that a current depressive episode is characterized by melancholia. • 6A80.4 indicates a seasonal pattern of mood episode onset and remission. • 6A80.5 indicates a rapid cycling course (applicable only to bipolar type I and bipolar type II disorders).",
