  "text_en": "214 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders • A depressive episode should not be considered to be present if the individual is exhibiting normal grief symptoms, including some level of depressive symptoms, and the individual has experienced the death of a loved one within the past 6 months, or longer if a more extended period of bereavement is consistent with the normative response for grieving within the individual’s religious and cultural context. Individuals with no history of depressive episodes may experience depressive symptoms during bereavement, but this does not appear to indicate an increased risk of subsequently developing a mood disorder. However, a depressive episode can be superimposed on normal grief. The presence of a depressive episode during a period of bereavement is suggested by persistence of constant depressive symptoms 1 month or more following the loss (i.e. there are no periods of positive mood or enjoyment of activities); severe depressive symptoms, such as extreme beliefs of low self-worth and guilt not related to the lost loved one; or presence of psychotic symptoms, suicidal ideation or psychomotor retardation. A prior history of depressive disorder or bipolar disorder is important to consider in making this distinction. Developmental presentations • Depressive episodes are relatively rare in childhood, and occur with similar frequency among boys and girls. Rates increase significantly after puberty, and girls are approximately twice as likely as boys to experience a depressive episode. • All the characteristic features of a depressive episode can be observed in children and adolescents. As in adults, symptoms of a depressive episode should represent a change from prior functioning. Assessment of a depressive episode in younger children in particular is likely to rely on the report of other informants (e.g. parents) regarding signs and symptoms and the extent to which these represent a change from prior functioning. Affective cluster • In young children, depressed mood may present as somatic complaints (e.g. headaches, stomach pains), whining, increased separation anxiety or excessive crying. Depressed mood may sometimes present in children and adolescents as pervasive irritability. However, the presence of irritability is not in and of itself indicative of a depressive episode and may indicate the presence of another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder, or be a normal reaction to frustration. Cognitive-behavioural cluster • As noted, reduced ability to concentrate or sustain attention may manifest as a decline in academic performance, increased time needed to complete school assignments or an inability to complete assignments. These symptoms of a depressive episode must be differentiated from problems with attention and concentration in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder that are not temporally tied to changes in mood or energy. Neurovegetative cluster • Hypersomnia and hyperphagia are more common symptoms of a depressive episode in adolescents than in adults. Appetite disturbance in children and adolescents may manifest in failure to gain weight as expected for age and development rather than as weight loss. • As with adults, children and adolescents experiencing a depressive episode are at increased risk of suicidality. In younger children, suicidality may manifest in passive statements (e.g. “I don’t want to be here any more”) or as themes of death during play, whereas adolescents may make more direct statements regarding their desire to die.
