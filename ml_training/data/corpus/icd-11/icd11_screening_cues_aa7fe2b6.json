Factitious disorder imposed on self can be understood as a disorder of illness behaviour and adoption of the sick role. Seeking attention, especially from health-care providers as a part of the sick role, often appears to be a motivation for the behaviour. • There is evidence that factitious disorder imposed on self in adulthood may be associated with being the victim of factitious disorder imposed on another in childhood. Boundary normality (threshold) • Some individuals with medical conditions may exaggerate their symptoms in order to gain more attention from medical professionals, family members or the community, or to gain access to additional treatment. A diagnosis of factitious disorder imposed on self should only be considered if there is evidence that the person is feigning, falsifying or intentionally inducing or aggravating the symptoms. Course features • The typical age at identification of individuals with factitious disorder imposed on self is 30–40 years, but at the time of first assessment it is often revealed that the disorder has been present without being detected for many years. • There is some evidence that individuals with factitious disorder imposed on self typically progress from less to more extreme modes of medical deception, and from an episodic to a chronic pattern. • Individuals with factitious disorder imposed on self often do not provide accurate histories",
