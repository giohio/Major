  "text_en": "affecting disorders and diseases classified elsewhere Psychological or behavioural factors affecting disorders and diseases classified elsewhere 649 manifestations, course or treatment of the medical condition. In cases where the excessive attention paid to the bodily symptoms does adversely affect the medical condition (e.g. repeated contact with medical professionals that result in medically unwarranted investigative procedures that have made the medical condition worse), both diagnoses may be assigned if it is clinically useful to do so. Boundary with secondary mental or behavioural syndromes associated with disorders and diseases classified elsewhere In secondary mental or behavioural syndromes associated with disorders and diseases classified elsewhere, a medical condition is judged to be causing mental or behavioural symptoms through a direct physiological mechanism. In contrast, in psychological or behavioural factors affecting disorders and diseases classified elsewhere, the psychological or behavioural factors are judged to affect the manifestations, course or treatment of the medical condition. In both cases, there is a temporal relationship between the psychological and behavioural manifestations and the medical condition, but the presumed causal relationship is in the opposite direction in each. Boundary with other co-occurring mental disorders and medical conditions Whereas co-occurrence of a mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder and a medical condition may have an impact on the management of the medical condition (e.g. medications used in the treatment of the mental disorder interacting with medications used to treat the medical condition), psychological or behavioural factors affecting disorders and diseases classified elsewhere would only be diagnosed if the mental disorder itself is having a negative impact on the manifestations, course or treatment of the medical condition. Boundary with personality difficulty Personality difficulty refers to pronounced, longstanding personality characteristics that may affect treatment or health services but do not rise to the level of severity to merit a diagnosis of personality disorder. In personality difficulty, there are difficulties in the individual’s way of experiencing and thinking about the self, others and the world that may be intermittently manifested in maladaptive patterns of cognitive and emotional experience and expression. The stress associated with being diagnosed or living with a serious medical condition is one factor that could potentially precipitate an exacerbation of personality difficulty. The category 6E40.2 Personality traits or coping style affecting disorders and diseases classified elsewhere, on the other hand, would describe the situation in which personality difficulty has an adverse effect on the manifestations, course or treatment of a medical condition. In clinical practice, however, personality difficulty and a medical condition may be mutually exacerbating, in which case both diagnoses may be assigned if it is clinically useful to do so.
