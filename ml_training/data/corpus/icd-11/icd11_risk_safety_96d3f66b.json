  "text_en": "dysmorphic disorder symptoms tends to be gradual. The disorder is recurrent, chronic and likely to persist without intervention. • Prevalence of body dysmorphic disorder among adolescents is estimated at approximately 2%, with higher prevalence among females. Prevalence rates are likely an underestimate because shame, embarrassment and stigma about symptoms frequently interfere with help-seeking behaviours. • Symptom presentation is similar across all age groups. However, differentiating between normality and body dysmorphic disorder in adolescence may be complicated by the emergence of developmentally normative concerns about body image that occur during this stage. • The course and severity of the disorder tends to be worse among individuals with an earlier onset (prior to the age of 18 years). Specifically, these individuals are at increased risk of suicide, present with more co-occurring mental disorders, have poorer insight, and are more likely to have experienced a gradual progression of symptom onset than individuals who develop body dysmorphic disorder in adulthood. Young people with body dysmorphic disorder are also at increased risk of school dropout, potentially affecting their academic and social development. Culture-related features • The symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder are similar across cultures, but specific concerns are shaped by cultural standards regarding what is considered attractive, acceptable, normal or desired. For example, populations in East Asia might be focused on epicanthal folds, and concerns about skin colour may be associated with racialized conceptions of desirable body characteristics. • Within more collectivistic cultures, or cultures that emphasize shame, the nature of the concern about bodily deformities may be focused on anxiety about causing offence to others. • Some cultural concepts of distress focus on perceptions of abnormal bodily features and may shape the symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder. For example, the shubo-kyofu (“fear of a deformed body”) subtype of taijin kyofusho has been reported primarily in Japan; it is characterized by intense fear of offending, embarrassing or hurting others through the person’s appearance, which is perceived as deformed. Insight is typically poor to absent. Sex- and/or gender-related features • Although prevalence rates are similar for both genders, differences in presentation have been described. Women are more likely to experience co-occurring eating disorders, whereas men are more likely to be concerned with the appearance of their genitalia and their overall physique (i.e. muscle dysmorphia).
