The behaviour may occur in brief episodes scattered throughout the day or in less frequent but more sustained periods. General cultural considerations for body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders • People who may inflict bodily harm to themselves (e.g. self-flagellation or self-cutting) as a part of religious ceremonies should not be assigned this diagnosis. 6B25.0 Trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) Essential (required) features • The presentation is characterized by: • recurrent pulling of the individual’s hair; • unsuccessful attempts to stop or decrease hair pulling; • significant hair loss results from pulling behaviour. • The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Additional clinical features • Hair pulling may occur from any region of the body where hair grows. However, the most common sites are the scalp, eyebrows and eyelids. Less frequently reported sites are axillary, facial, pubic and peri-rectal regions. Patterns of hair loss are variable, with some areas of complete alopecia and others with thinning hair density. • Individuals with trichotillomania may pull hair in a widely distributed pattern (i.e. pulling single hairs from all over a site) such that hair loss may not be clearly visible. Alternately, individuals may attempt to conceal or camouflage hair loss (e.g. by using makeup, scarves or wigs).
