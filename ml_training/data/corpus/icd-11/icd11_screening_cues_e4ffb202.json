  "text_en": "Dissociative disorders 393 • Internal and external factors such as emotional stress, anxiety or negative affect, sensory overstimulation, sleep deprivation or substance use can exacerbate symptom intensity. Some individuals with depersonalization-derealization disorder report that physical stimulation (e.g. exercise, mild self-injury) or comforting interpersonal interactions can reduce symptom intensity. • Depersonalization-derealization disorder often co-occurs with mood disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders or personality disorder. However, co-occurrence of these diagnoses does not appear to alter the severity of depersonalization or derealization symptoms. • Although a history of verbal or emotional abuse, neglect and other forms of childhood interpersonal trauma are associated with the development of depersonalization- derealization disorder, the association is not as strong as for other dissociative disorders (e.g. dissociative amnesia, dissociative identity disorder). Some cases of depersonalization- derealization disorder develop with what appears to be an onset “out of the blue” that cannot be linked to any identifiable triggers. • Psychoactive substance use, especially of marijuana or hallucinogens, is a common precipitant of depersonalization and derealization symptoms. However, depersonalization- derealization disorder diagnosis can only be assigned if the symptoms persist beyond the period of intoxication or withdrawal. Developmental presentations • Children often have significant difficulty verbalizing their subjective experiences of depersonalization or derealization. They are also less likely than adults to experience unease or distress caused by these symptoms. • Depersonalization in adolescents may lead to poor academic achievement. Culture-related features • Intentionally induced experiences of depersonalization and derealization can be desired objectives of spiritual or meditative practices that are common in many religions and cultures, and should not be assigned a diagnosis of depersonalization-derealization disorder. Transient distressing experiences of depersonalization and derealization may emerge initially during these practices, but abate as the person acquires proficiency. • However, some individuals who initially induce these states intentionally or experience them as part of their religious practice may lose control over them and develop persistent symptoms that warrant assigning the diagnosis.
