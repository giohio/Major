  "text_en": "speech dysfluency is persistent over time. • The onset of speech dysfluency occurs during the developmental period, and speech fluency is markedly below what would be expected based on age. • Speech dysfluency results in significant impairment in social communication or in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. • The speech dysfluency is not better accounted for by a disorder of intellectual development, a disease of the nervous system, a sensory impairment or a structural abnormality. Neurodevelopmental disorders | Developmental speech and language disorders 116 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders Additional clinical features • Developmental speech fluency disorder includes cluttering, in which speech tends to be rapid, erratic and dysrhythmic, with breakdown in fluency and clarity, often with deletion or collapsing of syllables and omissions of word endings. • Developmental speech fluency disorder may be accompanied by physical tension in the speech musculature, as well as body tension, struggle behaviour and secondary mannerisms, such as facial grimacing, eye blinking, head movements, and arm and leg movements such as leg tapping or fist clenching. • Developmental speech fluency disorder is often accompanied by anxiety in anticipation of speaking and avoidance of speaking. • The extent of the problem varies across situations and can be more severe when there is pressure to communicate. • Developmental speech fluency disorder may be associated with a broader range of speech and language abnormalities. • Occasionally, onset of dysfluency can be related to a significant psychological event such as bereavement, and is sometimes referred to as “psychogenic stammering”. When this occurs during the developmental period, it may be diagnosed as developmental speech fluency disorder. • Approximately 60% of children with developmental speech fluency disorder exhibit co- occurring developmental speech and language disorders. • Among adolescents and adults with chronic speech dysfluencies, social anxiety is common and may exacerbate dysfluency. As many as 40–60% of these individuals meet the diagnostic requirements for social anxiety disorder. Boundary with normality (threshold) • Many typically developing children show minor dysfluencies during the preschool years. Course features • The course of developmental speech fluency disorder may be relatively brief in many cases, with the majority of children (65–85%) remitting, without intervention, prior to puberty. Among these children, recovery is typically within the first 2 years after onset. • The impact of developmental speech fluency disorder may be evident as early as 3 years of age, with impairments in emotional, behavioural and social domains compared to typically developing peers.
