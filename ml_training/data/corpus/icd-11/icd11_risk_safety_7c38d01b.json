Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Substance dependence Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours 467 Boundary with normality (threshold) • Frequent or even daily substance use of a substance does not automatically imply a diagnosis of substance dependence. There must also be evidence of the essential features of substance dependence, such as impaired control over use, increasing precedence of use over other life priorities or physiological features. • The presence of physiological features such as tolerance and withdrawal is sometimes referred to as “physiological dependence”. These features may occur, for example, in response to prolonged therapeutic use of certain medications, such as in patients who are appropriately prescribed opioid analgesics for cancer pain. By themselves, however, these features are not sufficient for a diagnosis of substance dependence, which also requires either impaired control over substance use or increasing precedence of substance use over other activities. Course features • The course of substance dependence varies by substance, frequency, intensity and duration of use. The central features of the dependence syndrome may be overshadowed by the harms to physical and mental health that patients with dependence often experience, and for which they frequently seek treatment. Numerous medical conditions can occur due to substance use in the course of substance dependence. These conditions tend to be specific for each substance, although some are shared across substances. Negative consequences to physical health reflect the known pharmacological effects of the relevant substance, the toxic effects of the substance on tissues and organs, or the route of administration (e.g. intravenous self-administration). Examples include alcoholic cirrhosis, infective endocarditis and HIV/AIDS. Medical conditions caused by substance use should be diagnosed separately. Developmental presentations • Substance dependence may develop more rapidly during adolescence than is usual during adulthood, especially when there are familial or other risk factors for substance dependence. • Tolerance to psychoactive substances may develop rapidly in adolescents and young adults, and may decline equally rapidly when substance use ceases or is reduced in quantity or frequency. • Withdrawal symptoms are well recognized in neonates born to women with substance dependence who have used psychoactive substances during pregnancy. However, the presence of a withdrawal state in a neonate should not be the sole basis for a diagnosis of substance dependence in the mother. • Older adults often have reduced tolerance to substances.
