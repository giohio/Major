Other manifestations of borderline pattern, not all of which may be present in a given individual at a given time, include the following: • a view of the self as inadequate, bad, guilty, disgusting and contemptible; • an experience of the self as profoundly different and isolated from other people, and a painful sense of alienation and pervasive loneliness; • proneness to rejection hypersensitivity, problems in establishing and maintaining consistent and appropriate levels of trust in interpersonal relationships, and frequent misinterpretation of social signals. Additional clinical features of personality disorder • Personality disorder tends to arise when individuals’ life experiences provide inadequate support for typical personality development, given the person’s temperament (the aspect of personality that is considered to be innate, reflecting basic genetic and neurobiological processes). Thus, early life adversity is a risk factor for later development of personality disorder, as it is for many other mental disorders. However, it is not determinative: some individuals’ temperament allows typical personality development despite an extremely adverse early environment. Nonetheless, in the context of a history of early adversity, ongoing behavioural, emotional or interpersonal difficulties suggest that a personality disorder diagnosis should be considered.
