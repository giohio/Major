  "text_en": "(e.g. changes in sleep or irritability during adolescence). Factors to consider include the episodicity and a marked, co-occurring, change in cognitions (e.g. racing thoughts) or behaviours (e.g. increased activity level). • Increased irritability in younger children may manifest as excessive or more severe tantrums or increased physical aggression (e.g. throwing things, or hitting). Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis) Boundary with manic episode The symptoms of hypomanic episodes may be qualitatively similar to those of manic episodes, but the mood disturbance is not sufficiently severe to result in marked impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning, or to require intensive treatment (e.g. hospitalization) to prevent harm to self or others, and is not accompanied by delusions or hallucinations. Boundary with mixed episode Manic symptoms in a mixed episode may be qualitatively similar to those of a hypomanic episode but, unlike in a hypomanic episode, the mood disturbance in a mixed episode is sufficiently severe to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning or to require intensive treatment (e.g. hospitalization) to prevent harm to self or others, or is accompanied by delusions or hallucinations. Moreover, in a mixed episode several prominent manic symptoms occur simultaneously or alternate rapidly with several prominent depressive symptoms such as dysphoric mood, expressed beliefs of worthlessness, hopelessness or suicidal ideation, which are not characteristic of a hypomanic episode. Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Many features of a hypomanic episode – such as increased activity, rapid speech and over- talkativeness, distractibility and impulsivity – can be observed in individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Differentiating between these disorders can be particularly challenging among children and adolescents. However, in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, symptoms have their onset before the age of 12 years, are persistent over time (i.e. are not episodic), and are not temporally tied to changes in mood or energy (e.g. are not accompanied by mood elevation). However, rates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are substantially elevated compared to the general population among children and adolescents diagnosed with bipolar disorders, and both diagnoses may be assigned if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met.
