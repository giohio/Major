Individuals with oppositional defiant disorder with chronic irritability-anger typically display other features of oppositional defiant disorder, including defiant, headstrong or vindictive behaviours, which are not characteristic of intermittent explosive disorder. In addition, individuals with intermittent explosive disorder are more likely to exhibit significant physical aggression. Boundary with conduct-dissocial disorder People with intermittent explosive disorder may come into conflict with other people and with law enforcement because of their explosive outbursts, but these episodes do not constitute a more general pattern of antisocial behaviour characteristic of conduct-dissocial disorder (e.g. rule violations, lying, theft). In addition, intermittent explosive disorder is characterized by impulsive aggression, while aggression in conduct-dissocial disorder is often premeditated and instrumental. Boundary with personality disorder Due to interpersonal, occupational and other consequences of a recurrent pattern of verbal and physical aggression, some individuals with intermittent explosive disorder are likely to meet the diagnostic requirements for personality disorder with prominent features of disinhibition. Both diagnoses may be assigned if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met, but the utility of assigning an additional diagnosis of personality disorder in such cases depends on the specific clinical situation. Boundary with other mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders Aggressive outbursts may occur as a part of a number of mental disorders (e.g. disorders specifically associated with stress, mood disorders, schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders). In general, an additional diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not be given when the outbursts are better accounted for by another disorder. Boundary with the effects of psychoactive substances, including medications Explosive aggressive behaviours may occur during substance intoxication or withdrawal. Intermittent explosive disorder should not be diagnosed if the outbursts are solely attributable to intoxication or the disinhibiting effects of alcohol, drugs or medication. However, among individuals with intermittent explosive disorder, alcohol and substance use are commonly associated with episodes of aggressive behaviour.
