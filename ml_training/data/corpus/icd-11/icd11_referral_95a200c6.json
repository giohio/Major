Common manifestations of detachment, not all of which may be present in a given individual at a given time, include the following. Social detachment Social detachment is characterized by avoidance of social interactions, lack of friendships and avoidance of intimacy. Individuals with prominent detachment do not enjoy social interactions, and avoid all kinds of social contact and social situations as far as possible. They engage in little to no “small talk”, even if initiated by others (e.g. at store check-out counters), seek out employment that does not involve interactions with others, and even refuse promotions if these would entail more interaction with others. They have few to no friends or even casual acquaintances. Their interactions with family members tend to be minimal and superficial. They rarely, if ever, engage in any intimate relationships, and are not particularly interested in sexual relations. Emotional detachment Emotional detachment is characterized by reserve, aloofness and limited emotional expression and experience. Individuals with prominent detachment keep to themselves as far as possible, even in obligatory social situations. They are typically aloof, responding to direct attempts at social engagement only briefly and in ways that discourage further conversation. Emotional detachment also encompasses emotional inexpressiveness, both verbally and non-verbally. Individuals with prominent detachment do not talk about their feelings, and it is difficult to discern what they might be feeling from their behaviours. In extreme cases, there is a lack of emotional experience itself, and they are non-reactive to either negative or positive events, with a limited capacity for enjoyment. 6D11.2 Dissociality The core feature of the dissociality trait domain is disregard for the rights and feelings of others, encompassing both self-centredness and lack of empathy. Common manifestations of dissociality, not all of which may be present in a given individual at a given time, include the following. Self-centredness Self-centredness in individuals with prominent dissociality is manifested in a sense of entitlement, believing and acting as if they deserve – without further justification – whatever they want, preferentially above what others may want or need, and that this “fact” should be obvious to others. Self-centredness can be manifested both actively/intentionally and passively/unintentionally. Active – and usually intentional – manifestations of self-centredness include expectation of others’ admiration, attention-seeking behaviours to ensure being the centre of others’ focus, and negative behaviours (e.g. anger, “temper tantrums”, denigrating others) when the admiration and attention that the individual expects are not granted. Typically, such individuals believe that they have many admirable qualities, that their accomplishments are outstanding, that they have achieved or will achieve greatness, and that others should admire them. Passive and unintentional manifestations of self-centredness reflect a kind of obliviousness that other individuals matter as much as oneself. In this aspect of dissociality, the individual’s concern is with their own needs, desires and comfort, and those of others simply are not considered.
