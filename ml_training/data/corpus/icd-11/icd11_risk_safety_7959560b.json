  "text_en": "• Gender differences in clinical presentation or severity of symptoms have not been observed. Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis) Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder – particularly children and adolescents – may steal impulsively. However, impulsivity and disregard for consequences in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are typically observed across multiple contexts and situations. Furthermore, individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder do not exhibit tension or affective arousal prior to stealing, and gratification or relief once the theft is committed. Boundary with bipolar type I disorder and schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders Stealing may be associated with manic or mixed episodes in individuals with bipolar type I disorder. However, in such cases, stealing does not continue once the mood episode has ended, whereas in individuals with kleptomania stealing is not exclusively associated with mood episodes. Some individuals with delusions or hallucinations may steal in response to command hallucinations or in the context of a delusional system, and kleptomania should not be diagnosed in such cases. Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorder Stealing in kleptomania can sometimes be described as “compulsive” by lay people and also by some health professionals. Compulsions observed in obsessive-compulsive disorder are almost never experienced as inherently pleasurable; they typically occur in response to intrusive, unwanted and typically anxiety-provoking obsessions. In contrast, stealing in kleptomania is preceded by an increasing sense of tension or affective arousal and is followed by an experience of pleasure, excitement or gratification. Boundary with hoarding disorder Some individuals with hoarding disorder steal objects as part of a pattern of excessive accumulation, and individuals with kleptomania may hoard stolen objects. However, individuals with hoarding disorder accumulate possessions to the extent that living spaces becoming so cluttered that their use or safety is compromised. Boundary with conduct-dissocial disorder and personality disorder with prominent dissocial traits Individuals with conduct-dissocial disorder and personality disorder with prominent dissocial features may commit theft as part of more pervasive pattern of antisocial behaviour, and often for discernible motives such as personal gain or revenge rather than to relieve symptoms of tension. Individuals with kleptomania do not exhibit antisocial behaviour other than stealing. Impulse control disorders | Kleptomania",
