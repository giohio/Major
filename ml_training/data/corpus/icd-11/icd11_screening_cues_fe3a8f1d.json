Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis) for chronic motor tic disorder and chronic phonic tic disorder Boundary with autism spectrum disorder and stereotyped movement disorder Repetitive and stereotyped motor movements such as whole-body movements (e.g. rocking) and unusual hand or finger movements can be a characteristic feature of autism spectrum disorder and of stereotyped movement disorder. These behaviours can appear similar to tics but are differentiated because they tend to be more stereotyped, last longer than the duration of a typical tic, tend to emerge at a younger age, are not characterized by premonitory sensory urges, are often experienced by the individual as soothing or rewarding, and can generally be interrupted with distraction. Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorder Repetitive, recurrent movements or vocalizations can also be symptomatic of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Tics can be differentiated from obsessive-compulsive disorder because they appear unintentional in nature and clearly utilize a discrete muscle group. However, it can be difficult to distinguish between complex tics and compulsions associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Although tics (both complex and simple) are preceded by premonitory sensory urges, which may diminish over time, tics are not aimed at neutralizing antecedent cognitions (e.g. obsessions) or reducing physiological arousal (e.g. anxiety). Many individuals exhibit symptoms of both obsessive- compulsive disorder and chronic motor tic disorder or chronic phonic tic disorder, and both diagnoses may be assigned if the diagnostic requirements for each are met. Boundary with self-injurious and self-mutilating behaviours With enough force and repetition, motor tics may lead to self-injury. However, unlike self-injurious and self-mutilating behaviour, chronic motor tic disorder is not associated with an intention to cause self-injury.
