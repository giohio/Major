This typically occurs in the form of vivid intrusive memories or images; flashbacks, which can vary from mild (there is a transient sense of the event occurring again in the present) to severe (there is a complete loss of awareness of present surroundings); or repetitive dreams or nightmares that are thematically related to the traumatic event. Re-experiencing is typically accompanied by strong or overwhelming emotions, such as fear or horror, and strong physical sensations. Re-experiencing in the present can also involve feelings of being overwhelmed or immersed in the same intense emotions that were experienced during the traumatic event, without a prominent cognitive aspect, and may occur in response to reminders of the event. Reflecting on or ruminating about the event and remembering the feelings experienced at that time are not sufficient to meet the re-experiencing requirement. • Reminders likely to produce re-experiencing of the traumatic event are deliberately avoided. Deliberate avoidance may take the form either of active internal avoidance of thoughts and memories related to the event, or external avoidance of people, conversations, activities or situations reminiscent of the event. In extreme cases, the person may change their environment (e.g. move house or change jobs) to avoid reminders. • There are persistent perceptions of heightened current threat – for example, as indicated by hypervigilance or an enhanced startle reaction to stimuli such as unexpected noises. Hypervigilant people constantly guard themselves against danger, and feel themselves or others close to them to be under immediate threat either in specific situations or more generally. They may adopt new behaviours designed to ensure safety (e.g. not sitting with their back to the door, repeatedly checking in vehicles’ rear-view mirrors). In complex post-traumatic stress disorder, unlike in post-traumatic stress disorder, the startle reaction may in some cases be diminished rather than enhanced. • The presentation is characterized by severe and pervasive problems in affect regulation. Examples include heightened emotional reactivity to minor stressors, violent outbursts, reckless or self-destructive behaviour, dissociative symptoms when under stress, and emotional numbing – particularly the inability to experience pleasure or positive emotions. • Persistent beliefs about oneself as diminished, defeated or worthless are accompanied by deep and pervasive feelings of shame, guilt or failure related to the stressor. For example, the individual may feel guilty about not having escaped from or succumbing to the adverse circumstance, or not having been able to prevent the suffering of others. • Persistent difficulties in sustaining relationships and in feeling close to others are present. The individual may consistently avoid, deride or have little interest in relationships and social engagement more generally. Alternatively, there may be occasional intense relationships, but the individual has difficulty sustaining them. • The disturbance results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.
