During adolescence and adulthood, depressive disorders are often a presenting feature. • Co-occurrence of autism spectrum disorder with other mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders is common across the lifespan.

Prenatal exposure to valproate is also associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder. • Some individuals with autism spectrum disorder are capable of functioning adequately by making an exceptional effort to compensate for their symptoms during childhood, adolescence or adulthood.
