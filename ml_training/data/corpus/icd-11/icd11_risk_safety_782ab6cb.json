Boundary with harmful pattern of non-psychoactive substance use If the harm to health is a result of a known episodic or continuous pattern of non-psychoactive substance use, harmful pattern of non-psychoactive substance use is the appropriate diagnosis rather than episode of harmful use of non-psychoactive substances. Substance use is generally considered to be following a pattern if there has been at least episodic or intermittent use over a period of at least 12 months, or continuous use over at least 1 month. If harm is caused by use of a non-psychoactive substance but no information is available about the pattern or history of substance use, a diagnosis of episode of harmful use of non-psychoactive substances may be assigned until such time as evidence for a pattern of use is ascertained. Boundary with injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes When use of a non-psychoactive substance results in injury or life-threatening symptoms (e.g. coma, severe cardiac, respiratory symptoms), a diagnosis from the grouping of harmful effects of substances in Chapter 22 on injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes should also be assigned. 6C4H.1 Harmful pattern of use of non-psychoactive substances Essential (required) features • A pattern of repeated or continuous use of a non-psychoactive substance that has caused clinically significant damage to a person’s physical health or mental health is required for diagnosis. • Harm to the health of the individual occurs due to the direct or secondary toxic effects of the non-psychoactive substance on body organs and systems, or a harmful route of administration. • The pattern of use of the relevant substance is evident over a period of at least 12 months if substance use is episodic or at least 1 month if use is continuous. • The harm to health is not better accounted",
