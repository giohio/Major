However, in partial dissociative identity disorder, there may be occasional, limited and transient episodes in which a distinct personality state assumes executive control to engage in circumscribed behaviours (e.g. in response to extreme emotional states, episodes of self-harm or the re-enactment of traumatic memories). In partial dissociative identity disorder, the non-dominant personality states are not elaborated to the extent observed in dissociative identity disorder. For example, they may not be oriented to the present, may have the identity of a child, or may be mostly or exclusively involved in re-enacting traumatic memories. In addition, there are typically (although not always) significant episodes of amnesia in dissociative identity disorder, which may be severe. In contrast, episodes of amnesia in partial dissociative identity disorder – if present – are typically brief and restricted to extreme emotional states or episodes of self-harm. Boundary with other dissociative disorders Dissociative identity disorder is distinguished from other dissociative disorders by the presence of two distinct personality states that recurrently take executive control of the individual’s consciousness and functioning. This does not occur in any other dissociative disorder (except possibly for limited circumstances in partial dissociative identity disorder, as described above). An additional dissociative disorder diagnosis should not be assigned based on phenomena that occur in specific relationship to changes in personality states (e.g. memory loss, changes in motor or sensory functioning, experiences of depersonalization and derealization). Boundary with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders Individuals with dissociative identity disorder may report experiencing symptoms such as hearing voices or intrusive thoughts that may also occur in schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders. However, individuals with dissociative identity disorder do not typically exhibit delusions, formal thought disorder or negative symptoms (as in schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder), or rapid-onset and rapidly fluctuating symptoms (as in acute and transient psychotic disorder). In the absence of other symptoms supporting a diagnosis of schizophrenia or another primary psychotic disorder, intrusive phenomena such as hearing voices may suggest the presence of dissociative personality states. Boundary with post-traumatic stress disorder and complex post-traumatic stress disorder Individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder and complex post-traumatic stress disorder may experience alterations in identity and sense of agency during episodes of re-experiencing of traumatic events (e.g. during flashbacks). For example, they may feel that they are unable to control their experiences or reactions during the re-experiencing episode, or that they are in a different time in their own lives. However, these episodes are not characterized by a distinct personality state taking executive control of the individual’s consciousness and functioning. Because dissociative identity disorder is commonly associated with serious or chronic traumatic life events, it may co-occur with post-traumatic stress disorder or complex post-traumatic stress disorder, and both diagnoses may be assigned if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met.
