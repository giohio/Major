Cultural preoccupation with body weight and shape – for example, due to global dissemination of body ideals through mass media (typically low weight in women and muscular physique in men) – has contributed to increased rates of eating disorders in many parts of the world. The global obesity epidemic has also contributed to social concerns about eating and weight. • The prevalence of feeding and eating disorders varies by region, including differences by gender. For example, weight concerns and eating disturbances are more prevalent among men in some Asian and eastern Mediterranean societies than in the Americas. 6B80 Anorexia nervosa Essential (required) features • Significantly low body weight for the individual’s height, age, developmental stage or weight history is required for diagnosis. A commonly used threshold is body mass index (BMI) of less than 18.5 kg/m2 in adults and BMI for age under the 5th percentile in children and adolescents. Rapid weight loss (e.g. more than 20% of total body weight within 6 months) may replace the essential feature of low body weight, as long as other diagnostic requirements are met. Children and adolescents may exhibit failure to gain weight as expected based on the individual developmental trajectory rather than weight loss. • Low body weight is not better accounted for by another medical condition or the unavailability of food. • The presentation is characterized by a persistent pattern of restrictive eating or other behaviours aimed at establishing or maintaining abnormally low body weight, typically associated with extreme fear of weight gain. Behaviours may be aimed at reducing energy intake by fasting, choosing low-calorie food, excessively slow eating of small amounts of food, and hiding or spitting out food, as well as by purging behaviours such as self- induced vomiting and use of laxatives, diuretics or enemas, or omission of insulin doses in individuals with diabetes. Behaviours may also be aimed at increasing energy expenditure through excessive exercise, motor hyperactivity, deliberate exposure to cold and use of medication that increases energy expenditure (e.g. stimulants, weight-loss medication, herbal products for reducing weight, thyroid hormones). • Excessive preoccupation with body weight or shape is apparent.
