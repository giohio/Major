Neurocognitive disorders | Dementia Neurocognitive disorders | Dementia Neurocognitive disorders 619 Additional clinical features for dementia • Symptom course may provide information about the etiology of dementia (see the descriptions below of dementia due to specific etiologies). Most dementias are progressive (e.g. dementia due to Alzheimer disease, dementia due to Lewy body disease, frontotemporal dementia), whereas other forms are reversible (e.g. dementia related to nutritional or metabolic abnormalities), stable (e.g. some cases of dementia due to cerebrovascular disease) or rapidly progressing (e.g. dementia due to prion disease). Boundary with normality (threshold) for dementia • Normal ageing is typically associated with some degree of cognitive change. Dementia is differentiated from normal ageing by the severity or magnitude of neurocognitive impairment relative to expectations for age, and by functional impairment in everyday skills and tasks. Deviation from normal ageing can be determined by standardized assessment using appropriately normed measures. When cognitive difficulties consistent with normal ageing are present and clinically relevant, the symptom code MB21.0 Age-associated cognitive decline may be used. Course features for dementia • Onset and course of symptoms varies considerably by dementia etiology. (See additional information below regarding symptom onset and course for dementia due to specific etiologies.) Developmental presentations for dementia • Dementia in children or young adults is rare, and often caused by neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, a group of lysosomal storage disorders. • Dementia due to Down syndrome occurs in about 50% or more of individuals with Down syndrome, and typically emerges after the fourth decade of life. • Risk of dementia increases in older adulthood.
