Neurodevelopmental disorders | Secondary-parented categories in neurodevelopmental disorders 156 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders • The pattern of co-occurring disorders appears to vary with developmental stage. Children with Tourette syndrome are more likely to experience attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorder and separation anxiety disorder compared to adolescents and adults. Adolescents and adults are more likely than children to develop a depressive disorder, a disorder due to substance use or a bipolar disorder. Culture-related features • Symptoms of Tourette syndrome are consistent across cultural groups. • If vocalizations or movements have a specific function or meaning in the context of an individual’s culture and are used in ways that are consistent with that cultural function or meaning, they should not be considered evidence of Tourette syndrome. Sex- and/or gender-related features • Tourette syndrome is more common among males than females (gender ratio ranging from 2:1 to 4:1). • Course and symptom presentation do not vary by gender. • Women with persistent tic disorders may be more likely to experience co-occurring anxiety and fear-related disorders and depressive disorders. Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis) Boundary with autism spectrum disorder and stereotyped movement disorder Repetitive and stereotyped motor movements such as whole-body movements (e.g. rocking) and unusual hand or finger movements can be a characteristic feature of autism spectrum disorder and of stereotyped movement disorder. These behaviours can appear similar to tics, but are differentiated because they tend to be more stereotyped, last longer than the duration of a typical tic, tend to emerge at a younger age, are not characterized by premonitory sensory urges, are often experienced by the individual as soothing or rewarding, and can generally be interrupted with distraction.
