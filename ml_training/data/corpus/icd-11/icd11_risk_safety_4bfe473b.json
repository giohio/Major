Boundary with harmful pattern of non-psychoactive substance use If the harm to health is a result of a known episodic or continuous pattern of non-psychoactive substance use, harmful pattern of non-psychoactive substance use is the appropriate diagnosis rather than episode of harmful use of non-psychoactive substances.
