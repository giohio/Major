Boundary with normality (threshold) • An individual experiencing a grief reaction that is within a normative period given their cultural and religious context is considered to be experiencing normal bereavement, and should not be assigned a diagnosis of prolonged grief disorder. It is often important to consider whether other people who share the bereaved person’s cultural or religious perspective (e.g. family, friends, community) regard the response to the loss or duration of the reaction as abnormal. • Children and adolescents may respond to the loss of a primary attachment figure (e.g. a parent or caregiver) with an intense and sustained grief response (e.g. greater in intensity, symptomatology, duration) because of the role these individuals play in the child’s life. Preschool-aged children commonly have difficulty accepting the loss. Aspects of the grief response may be retriggered at various points during the individual’s development – for example, as new needs arise that would normally be supplied by the parent or caregiver. Generally, these reactions should be regarded as normal, and the diagnosis of prolonged grief disorder should be assigned with caution to children and adolescents in this situation.
