There are typically episodes of amnesia inconsistent with ordinary forgetting, which may be severe. • The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. schizophrenia or another primary psychotic disorder). • The symptoms are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system – including withdrawal effects – (e.g. blackouts or chaotic behaviour during substance intoxication), and are not due to a disease of the nervous system (e.g. complex partial seizures) or to a sleep-wake disorder (e.g. symptoms occur during hypnagogic or hypnopompic states). • The symptoms result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort. Additional clinical features • Alternation between distinct personality states is not always associated with amnesia. That is, one personality state may have awareness and recollection of the activities of another personality state during a particular episode. However, substantial episodes of amnesia are typically present at some point during the course of the disorder. • In individuals with dissociative identity disorder, it is common for one personality state to be “intruded upon” by aspects of other non-dominant, alternate personality states without their taking executive control, as in partial dissociative identity disorder. These intrusions may involve a range of features, including cognitive (intruding thoughts), affective (intruding affects such as fear, anger or shame), perceptual (e.g. intruding voices or fleeting visual perceptions), sensory (e.g. intruding sensations such as being touched, pain or altered perceived size of the body or of part of the body), motor (e.g. involuntary movements of an arm and hand) and behavioural (e.g. an action that lacks a sense of agency or ownership) features.
