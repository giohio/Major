In reactive attachment disorder, there is a persistent and pervasive pattern of inhibited, emotionally withdrawn behaviour, including minimal seeking of comfort when distressed and rare or minimal response to comfort when it is offered. In disinhibited social engagement disorder, there is a persistent and pervasive pattern of markedly abnormal social behaviours, in which the child displays reduced or absent reticence in approaching and interacting with unfamiliar adults.
