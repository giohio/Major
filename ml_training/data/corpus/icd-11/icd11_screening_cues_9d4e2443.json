Additional clinical features • Dementia due to prion disease is caused by a group of spongiform encephalopathies resulting from abnormal prion protein accumulation in the brain. These can be sporadic, genetic (caused by mutations in the prion protein gene) or transmissible (acquired from an infected individual). • Onset is insidious, and progression of symptoms and impairment is rapid, often characterized by neurocognitive deficits, ataxia and motor symptoms (e.g. myoclonus, chorea or dystonia). • Diagnosis is typically made on the basis of clinical presentation, brain imaging studies, presence of characteristic proteins in spinal fluid, EEG and/or genetic testing. Note: an appropriate diagnosis from the Human prion diseases grouping in Chapter 8 on diseases of the nervous system should also be assigned. 6D85.6 Dementia due to normal-pressure hydrocephalus Essential (required) features • All diagnostic requirements for dementia are met. • Dementia is presumed to be attributable to underlying normal-pressure hydrocephalus, as demonstrated by neuropsychological test data, neuroimaging data, medical tests and/ or clinical history. Neurocognitive disorders | Dementia due to diseases classified elsewhere Neurocognitive disorders | Dementia due to diseases classified elsewhere Neurocognitive disorders 631 Additional clinical features • Dementia due to normal-pressure hydrocephalus results from excess accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain as a result of idiopathic, non-obstructive causes, but can also be secondary to haemorrhage, infection or inflammation. • Progression is gradual but intervention (e.g. shunt) may result in improvement of symptoms,",
