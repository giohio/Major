Culture-related features • Little information is available about cultural influences on dysthymic disorder. The information on culture-related features for single episode depressive disorder and recurrent depressive disorder (p. 251) may be relevant. Sex- and/or gender-related features • Although dysthymic disorder is more common among women during early and middle adulthood, there are no notable gender differences among older adults with late-onset dysthymic disorder. Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis) Boundary with single episode depressive disorder and recurrent depressive disorder Dysthymic disorder is differentiated from single episode depressive disorder and recurrent depressive disorder by the number of symptoms and the course of the disorder. Dysthymic disorder is a chronic and persistent condition, and during the initial period of 2 years necessary to establish the diagnosis, the number and duration of symptoms are not sufficient to meet the diagnostic requirements for a diagnosis of single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder. After this initial period, if the number and severity of symptoms reaches the diagnostic threshold for a depressive episode in the context of an ongoing dysthymic disorder, both dysthymic disorder and either single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder may be diagnosed. Unlike dysthymic disorder, recurrent depressive disorder is episodic in nature. However, long periods of subthreshold depressive symptoms that occur following depressive episodes when there has not been an initial 2-year period of subthreshold symptoms are better diagnosed as single episode depressive disorder in partial remission or recurrent depressive disorder in partial remission. Boundary with bipolar and related disorders Individuals with a pattern of depressive symptoms that resembles dysthymic disorder who have a history of manic or mixed episodes should be diagnosed with bipolar type I disorder. A pattern of chronic mood instability that is characterized by periods of both depressive symptomatology, and that is not sufficiently severe or prolonged to meet the diagnostic requirements for a depressive episode and periods of hypomanic symptomatology should be diagnosed as cyclothymic disorder.
