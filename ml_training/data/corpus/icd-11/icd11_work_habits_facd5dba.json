Behaviours may be aimed at reducing energy intake by fasting, choosing low-calorie food, excessively slow eating of small amounts of food, and hiding or spitting out food, as well as by purging behaviours such as self- induced vomiting and use of laxatives, diuretics or enemas, or omission of insulin doses in individuals with diabetes. Behaviours may also be aimed at increasing energy expenditure through excessive exercise, motor hyperactivity, deliberate exposure to cold and use of medication that increases energy expenditure (e.g. stimulants, weight-loss medication, herbal products for reducing weight, thyroid hormones). • Excessive preoccupation with body weight or shape is apparent. Low body weight is overvalued and central to the person’s self-evaluation, or the person’s body weight or shape is inaccurately perceived to be normal or even excessive.
