Early diagnosis of the etiology of a disorder of intellectual development, when possible, can assist in the prevention and management of related medical problems (e.g. frequent thyroid disease screening is recommended for individuals with Down syndrome). If the etiology of a disorder of intellectual development in a particular individual has been established, the diagnosis corresponding to that etiology should also be assigned. • Individuals with disorders of intellectual development are at greater risk of a variety of health (e.g. epilepsy) and social (e.g. poverty) problems across the lifespan. Boundary with normality (threshold) • In disorders of intellectual development, a measure of intelligence quotient (IQ) is not an isolated diagnostic requirement to distinguish disorder from normality, but should be considered a proxy measure of the “significant limitations in intellectual functioning” that partially characterize disorders of intellectual development. IQ scores may vary as a result of the technical properties of the specific test being used, the testing conditions and a variety of other variables, and also can vary substantially over the individual’s development and life-course. The diagnosis of disorders of intellectual development should not be made solely based on IQ scores but must also include a comprehensive evaluation of adaptive behaviour. • Scores on individually administered standardized tests of intellectual and adaptive functioning may vary considerably over the course of an individual’s development, and it is quite possible that, during the developmental period, a child may meet the diagnostic requirements of disorders of intellectual development on one occasion but not another. Multiple testing on different occasions during the developmental trajectory is necessary to establish a reliable estimate of functioning. • Special care should be taken in differentiating disorders of intellectual development from normality when evaluating people with communication, sensory or motor impairments; those exhibiting behavioural disturbances; immigrants; people with low literacy levels; people with mental disorders; people undergoing medical treatments (e.g. pharmacotherapy); and people who have experienced severe social or sensory deprivation. If not adequately addressed during the evaluation, these factors may reduce the validity of scores obtained on standardized or behavioural measures of intellectual and adaptive functioning. For example, the reliable use of standardized measures of intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour may pose particular challenges among individuals with motor coordination and communication impairments, and assessments must be selected that are appropriate to the individual’s capacities. • What is sometimes termed “borderline intellectual functioning”, defined as intellectual functioning between approximately 1 and 2 standard deviations below the mean, is not a diagnosable disorder. Nonetheless, such individuals may present many needs for support and interventions that are similar to those of people with disorders of intellectual development.
