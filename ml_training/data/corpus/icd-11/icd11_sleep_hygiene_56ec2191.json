Caffeine is a mild psychostimulant and diuretic that is found in the beans of the coffee plant (Coffea species), and is a constituent of coffee, cola drinks, chocolate, a range of proprietary “energy drinks” and weight-loss aids. It is the most commonly used psychoactive substance worldwide, and several clinical conditions related to its use are described, although severe disorders are comparatively rare considering its ubiquity. Caffeine intoxication related to consumption of relatively high doses (i.e. >1 g per day) is described. Caffeine withdrawal is common upon cessation of use among individuals who have used caffeine for a prolonged period or in large amounts. Caffeine-induced anxiety disorder has been described, often following intoxication or heavy use. 6C49 Disorders due to use of hallucinogens Disorders due to use of hallucinogens are characterized by the pattern and consequences of hallucinogen use. Several thousand compounds have hallucinogenic properties, many of which are found in plants (e.g. mescaline) and fungi (e.g. psilocybin) or are chemically synthesized (e.g. LSD). These compounds have primarily hallucinogenic properties, but some may also be stimulants. Much of the morbidity associated with these compounds arises from the acute effects related to hallucinogen intoxication. Hallucinogen dependence is rare, and hallucinogen withdrawal is not described. Among the mental disorders related to hallucinogen use, hallucinogen-induced psychotic disorder is the most frequently seen, although worldwide it is still fairly uncommon. 6C4A Disorders due to use of nicotine Disorders due to use of nicotine are characterized by the pattern and consequences of nicotine use. Nicotine is the active dependence-producing constituent of the tobacco plant, Nicotiana tabacum. Nicotine is used overwhelmingly through smoking cigarettes. Increasingly, it is also used in electronic cigarettes that vaporize nicotine dissolved in a carrier solvent for inhalation (i.e. “vaping”). Pipe smoking, chewing tobacco and inhaling snuff are minor forms of use. Nicotine is a highly potent addictive compound, and is the third most common psychoactive substance used worldwide after caffeine and alcohol. Nicotine dependence and nicotine withdrawal are well described, and nicotine-induced mental disorders are recognized. Tobacco is by far the most important cause worldwide of morbidity and mortality of all the psychoactive substances; this is due in part to its addictive constituent nicotine but more so to other constituents such as carcinogens and other hazardous and harmful compounds that are inhaled during smoking. Tobacco smoking is the leading cause of ill health and premature death among men, and is among the top 10 causes in women. Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours | Substance classes",
