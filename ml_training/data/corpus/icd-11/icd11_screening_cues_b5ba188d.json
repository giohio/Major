  "text_en": "Dissociative disorders 385 Culture-related features • Features of dissociative identity disorder can be influenced by the individual’s cultural background. For example, individuals may present with dissociative symptoms of movement, behaviour or cognition – such as non-epileptic seizures and convulsions, paralyses or sensory loss – in sociocultural settings where such symptoms are common. These symptoms typically remain persistent and debilitating until the underlying dissociative identity disorder is identified and treated. • Acculturation or prolonged intercultural contact may shape the characteristics of the dissociative identities; for example, identities in India may speak English exclusively and wear Western clothes as a sign of their difference from the usual personality state. • In some societies, presentations of dissociative identity disorder may occur after stressful exposures (e.g. recurrent parental affect dysregulation), which may or may not involve physical or sexual abuse. The tendency towards dissociative responses to stressors may be increased in cultures with less individualistic (“bounded”) conceptions of the self, or in circumstances of socioeconomic deprivation. Sex- and/or gender-related features • Prior to puberty, prevalence of dissociative identity disorder does not appear to vary by gender. After puberty, prevalence appears to be higher among females. • Significant gender differences have been observed in the symptoms of dissociative identity disorder across the lifespan. Females with dissociative identity disorder often present with more dissociative identities, and tend to experience more acute dissociative states (e.g. amnesia, conversion symptoms, self-mutilation). Males with dissociative identity disorder are more likely to deny their symptoms or to exhibit violent or criminal behaviours. Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis) Boundary with trance disorder and possession trance disorder Trance disorder is not characterized by the presence of two or more distinct personality states. In possession trance disorder, the individual’s customary sense of personal identity is replaced by an external “possessing” identity, which is attributed to the influence of a spirit, power, deity or other spiritual entity. Behaviours or movements are experienced as being controlled by the possessing agent. Individuals who describe both internal distinct personality states that assume executive control and episodes of being controlled by an external possessing identity should receive a diagnosis of dissociative identity disorder rather than possession trance disorder. Dissociative disorders | Dissociative identity disorder 386 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders Boundary with partial dissociative identity disorder In dissociative identity disorder, discontinuities in agency and sense of self are marked (manifested in episodes of executive control, often including amnesia, and greater elaboration of the personality states), whereas in partial dissociative identity disorder these discontinuities are less pronounced. In partial dissociative identity disorder, one personality state is dominant and functions in daily life (e.g. parenting, work), but is intruded upon by non-dominant personality states (dissociative intrusions). Unlike in dissociative identity disorder, the non-dominant personality states do not recurrently take executive control of the individual’s consciousness and functioning to the extent",
