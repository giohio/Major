In the absence of a report of the individual’s sexual thoughts, fantasies or urges, examples of other forms of evidence supporting the presence of a paedophilic arousal pattern include a preference for specific types of pornography; preference over other forms of sexual behaviour; planning and repeatedly seeking out opportunities to engage in paedophilic behaviour; or laboratory measures of relative viewing time (based on the finding that preferred sexual stimuli are gazed at longer than non-preferred sexual stimuli) and/or penile plethysmography. • Some individuals with paedophilic disorder are attracted only to males, others only to females, and others to both. • Some individuals act on their paedophilic urges only with family members, others only with people outside their immediate family, and others with both. Boundary with normality (threshold) • A broad range of sexual behaviour with peers may occur in children or adolescents. A diagnosis of paedophilic disorder should not be assigned on the basis of sexual behaviours among pre- or post-pubertal children or adolescents with peers who are close in age. Course features • Individuals with paedophilic disorder often report the onset of paedophilic sexual interest during adolescence. • Paedophilic disorder is relatively stable after young adulthood, but sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges and behaviours may change over time, such that an individual who was assigned a diagnosis of paedophilic disorder no longer meets the diagnostic requirements. Developmental presentations • Advancing age may be associated with decreasing paraphilic sexual arousal and decreasing behavioural manifestations of paedophilic disorder due to increased impulse control and decreased sexual drive.
