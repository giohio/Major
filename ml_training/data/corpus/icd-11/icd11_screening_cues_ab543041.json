Boundary with episode of harmful psychoactive substance use If the harm to health is a result of a single episode of use rather than a pattern of substance use, whether episodic or continuous, a diagnosis of episode of harmful psychoactive substance use should be assigned. Substance use is generally considered to be following a pattern if there has been at least episodic or intermittent use over a period of at least 12 months. If harm is caused by use of a substance but no information is available about the pattern or history of substance use, a diagnosis of episode of harmful psychoactive substance use may be assigned until such time as evidence for a pattern of use is ascertained. Boundary with substance dependence In substance dependence, individuals use a substance or substances persistently, despite harm and adverse consequences. Harm caused by such use may be similar to that observed in harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use. However, substance dependence also includes additional features of impaired ability to control use and increasing priority given to the substance use over other activities. Physiological features (e.g. tolerance) may also be present for applicable substances. If all diagnostic requirements for substance dependence are met for a particular substance, Harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use should not be assigned for that substance. Note: substance dependence is only applicable for some substances or substance classes (see Table 6.13, p. 450). Boundary with substance intoxication Substance intoxication is defined by substance use that results in clinically significantly, transient substance-specific symptoms (see Table 6.15, p. 475). Recovery from substance intoxication is generally complete and absent of physical or mental sequelae. A pattern or repeated intoxication may or may not result in harm to a person’s physical or mental health or to the health of others. If there is continuing damage or harm (e.g. the effects of hypoxia, the effects of prolonged hyperactivity or inactivity, tissue damage) as a result of repeated or continuous use of a psychoactive substance, a diagnosis of harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use may be assigned. If relevant at the time of the clinical encounter (e.g. in emergency settings), harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use may be diagnosed with an associated diagnosis of substance intoxication. Boundary with substance withdrawal Substance withdrawal occurs upon cessation or reduction of a substance in the context of physiological dependence, or when a substance has been taken for a prolonged period or in large amounts. Some features of substance withdrawal may include physical or mental harm (e.g. seizures, delusions, hallucinations, anxiety). If the symptoms are entirely explained by the withdrawal syndrome for the relevant substance (see Table 6.16, p. 484), an additional diagnosis of harmful pattern",
