Symptoms are typically from the following clusters: • having difficulty sustaining attention on tasks that do not provide a high level of stimulation or reward or require sustained mental effort; lacking attention to detail; making careless mistakes in school or work assignments; not completing tasks; • being easily distracted by extraneous stimuli or thoughts not related to the task at hand; often seeming not to listen when spoken to directly; frequently appearing to be daydreaming or to have their mind elsewhere; • losing things; being forgetful in daily activities; having difficulty remembering to complete upcoming daily tasks or activities; having difficulty planning, managing and organizing schoolwork, tasks and other activities. Note: inattention may not be evident when the individual is engaged in activities that provide intense stimulation and frequent rewards. Hyperactivity-impulsivity Several symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity that are persistent and sufficiently severe that they have a direct negative impact on academic, occupational or social functioning are among the essential components. These tend to be most evident in structured situations that require behavioural self-control. Symptoms are typically from the following clusters: • showing excessive motor activity; leaving their seat when expected to sit still; often running about; having difficulty sitting still without fidgeting (younger children); displaying feelings of physical restlessness and a sense of discomfort with being quiet or sitting still (adolescents and adults); • having difficulty engaging in activities quietly; talking too much; • blurting out answers in school or comments at work; having difficulty waiting their turn in conversation, games or activities; interrupting or intruding on others’ conversations or games; • having a tendency to act in response to immediate stimuli without deliberation or consideration of risks and consequences (e.g. engaging in behaviours with potential for physical injury; impulsive decisions; reckless driving). • Evidence of",
