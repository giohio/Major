Mood disorders | Mixed depressive and anxiety disorder Mood disorders 259 • Depressive symptoms include depressed mood or markedly diminished interest or pleasure in activities. • There are multiple anxiety symptoms, which may include feeling nervous, anxious or on edge, not being able to control worrying thoughts, fear that something awful will happen, having trouble relaxing, muscle tension or sympathetic autonomic symptoms. • Neither the depressive nor the anxiety symptoms – considered separately – are sufficiently severe, numerous or lasting to meet the diagnostic requirements of another depressive disorder or an anxiety or fear-related disorder. There is no history of manic or mixed episodes, which would indicate the presence of a bipolar disorder. • The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism), and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, including withdrawal effects (e.g. from alcohol, benzodiazepines). • The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort. Additional clinical features • Individuals with this mixture of comparatively mild symptoms of depression and anxiety are frequently seen in primary care, but many more cases exist among the population at large, which never come to clinical attention. Boundary with normality (threshold) • If worry is the only anxiety symptom (i.e. no sympathetic autonomic or other anxiety symptoms are present), a diagnosis of mixed depressive and anxiety disorder diagnosis is not appropriate. Course features • Epidemiological studies have yielded varying results regarding the course and onset of mixed depressive and anxiety disorder. • While there is some evidence to suggest that approximately half of individuals with mixed depressive and anxiety disorder will experience remission of symptoms within 1 year of onset, those who do not remit are at increased risk of developing a mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder that meets the full diagnostic requirements – typically for a depressive disorder or an anxiety or fear-related disorder.
