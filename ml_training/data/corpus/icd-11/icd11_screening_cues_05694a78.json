Sleep-wake disorders previously included in the ICD-10 chapter on mental and behavioural disorders include nightmare disorder, sleepwalking disorder, sleep terrors and “nonorganic” versions of insomnia disorders, hypersomnia disorders and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders (disorders of the sleep-wake schedule in ICD-10). The unified ICD-11 chapter on sleep-wake disorders reflects the fact that the pathophysiology of most of these disorders is complex and includes both physiological and psychological/ behavioural components. ICD-11 abandons outdated and incorrect assumptions about the etiology of sleep-wake disorders – in particular, the obsolete distinction between “organic” and “nonorganic” disorders. The chapter is intended to enhance patient care and public health by creating a more visible and accurate system that will enhance clinician awareness and improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment. Placement of these conditions in a separate chapter on sleep- wake disorders is in no way intended to indicate that they should not be diagnosed and treated by appropriately trained mental health professionals. Chapter 8. Diseases of the nervous system Diseases of the nervous system have a close relationship with mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders. Disorders in both chapters may affect cognition, emotional regulation or behaviour, and reflect dysfunctions in the psychological, biological or developmental processes. Given that mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders also affect the brain, in some instances the distinction between the two chapters is arbitrary and reflects professional tradition – especially the boundary between psychiatry and neurology – as much as biological or phenomenological differences between the conditions listed in each. For some conditions, the psychological, behavioural or developmental syndrome is classified in the mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders chapter, while the underlying etiology may be classified in diseases of the nervous system. This includes disorders of intellectual development, autism spectrum disorder and stereotyped movement disorder in the neurodevelopmental disorders grouping; and delirium, mild neurocognitive disorder, amnestic disorder and dementia in the neurocognitive disorders grouping, all of which are diagnosed regardless of etiology. If the etiology is known, the corresponding diagnosis should also be assigned, which is often but not always in in the chapter on diseases of the nervous system. The other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. developmental learning disorder, developmental speech or language disorder, developmental motor coordination disorder) are generally not diagnosed if the symptoms are fully accounted for by a disease of the nervous system. When mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental syndromes are judged to be a direct pathological consequence of a disease of the nervous system and are a specific focus of clinical attention, a diagnosis from the grouping secondary mental or behavioural syndromes associated with disorders and diseases classified elsewhere may be assigned. For example, a psychotic syndrome with prominent visual hallucinations that is judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of Parkinson disease would be diagnosed as secondary psychotic syndrome, with hallucinations along with a diagnosis of Parkinson disease. Tic disorders and acquired aphasia with epilepsy (Landau-Kleffner syndrome) were classified in ICD-10 as emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence, but in ICD-11 have been moved to the chapter on diseases of the nervous system. In addition, movement disorders caused by medications (e.g. drug-induced parkinsonism, drug-induced dystonia), which are associated with certain medications commonly used to treat mental disorders, are included among the diseases of the nervous system.",
