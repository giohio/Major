Thus, poor or incomplete response to standard treatments of, for example, depressive disorders and anxiety and fear-related disorders may suggest the presence of personality disorder. Relatedly, persistent functional impairment after resolution of the clinical syndrome(s) being treated may suggest the presence of personality disorder. • There is often considerable variability in the degree to which individuals and those around them agree that the individual’s behaviours reflect a particular trait. If there is a marked discrepancy between an individual’s self-description and the kinds of problematic behaviours exhibited, it often is helpful to interview someone who knows the person well. Marked differences between the individual’s self-description and the informant’s description may be suggestive of personality disorder. Boundary with normality (threshold) for personality disorder • Personality refers to an individual’s characteristic way of behaving and experiencing life, and of perceiving and interpreting themselves, other people, events and situations. Personality is manifested most directly in how individuals think and feel about themselves and their interpersonal relationships, how they behave in response to those thoughts and feelings and in response to others’ behaviours, and how they react to events in their lives and changes in the environment. An important characteristic of non-disordered personality is sufficient flexibility to react appropriately and to adapt to other people’s behaviours, life events and changes in the environment. In personality disorder, patterns of cognition, emotional experience, emotional expression and behaviour are sufficiently maladaptive (e.g. inflexible or poorly regulated) that they result in substantial distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. • To warrant a diagnosis of personality disorder, personality disturbance must be manifested across a range of personal and social situations over an extended period of time (e.g. lasting 2 years or more). Behaviour patterns that are apparent only in the context of specific relationships, social roles or environmental circumstances, or that have lasted for a shorter period of time, are not a sufficient basis for a diagnosis of personality disorder. Instead, the possibility that such behaviour patterns are a response to environmental circumstances must be considered. A focus on problems in the relevant relationship or in the environment (e.g. with family or school) may be more appropriate than a diagnosis of personality disorder in such cases. Course features • Manifestations of personality disturbance tend to appear first in childhood, increase during adolescence, and continue into adulthood, although individuals may not come to clinical attention until later in life. Caution should be exercised in applying the diagnosis to children because their personalities are still developing.
