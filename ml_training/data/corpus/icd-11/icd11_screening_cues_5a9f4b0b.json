  "text_en": "Relationship problems and maltreatment 707 Relationship problems and maltreatment Intimate partner and caregiver–child bonds are among the most important factors affecting human health. Threats to these bonds, through acts (e.g. physical maltreatment) or omissions (e.g. neglect), significantly affect physical, mental and social well-being. Mental disorders and other medical conditions can cause, be caused by, exacerbate or be exacerbated by relationship problems or maltreatment. Therefore, accurate diagnosis of relationship problems and maltreatment is important for appropriate treatment planning and care. The coding rules for relationship problems or maltreatment in ICD-11 are complex, and are therefore presented separately in this section. Different categories from Chapter 23 on external causes of morbidity or mortality and Chapter 24 on factors influencing health status or contact with health services are used to indicate the presence of relationship problems or maltreatment, depending on the purpose of the assessment and the point in time relative to the assessment that maltreatment has occurred or is suspected. Maltreatment is an umbrella term that comprises physical abuse, sexual abuse, psychological abuse and neglect. All categories are applied to the victim of the maltreatment, not to the perpetrator. In cases of mutual relationship distress or maltreatment where both parties in a dyad are being evaluated, the categories may be applied to both. Because relationship distress and different forms of maltreatment (physical, sexual, psychological or neglect) can co- occur, as many of these categories may be assigned together as necessary to describe the relevant clinical phenomena. ICD-11 uses consistent definitions of maltreatment across these different sets of categories. • Physical abuse (also called physical maltreatment) is defined as non-accidental acts of physical force that result – or have reasonable potential to result – in physical harm, or that evoke significant fear. • Sexual abuse (also called sexual maltreatment) is defined in adults as forced or coerced sexual acts, or sexual acts with someone who is unable to consent. In children, it is defined as sexual acts involving a child that are intended to provide sexual gratification to an adult. • Psychological abuse (also called psychological maltreatment) is defined as non-accidental verbal or symbolic acts that result in significant psychological harm. • Neglect is defined as egregious acts or omissions by a caregiver that deprive a child, or an adult who is incapable of self-care, of needed age-appropriate care, and that",
