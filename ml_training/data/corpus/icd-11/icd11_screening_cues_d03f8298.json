Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis) Boundary with developmental speech and language disorders Selective mutism is differentiated from the range of developmental speech and language disorders (i.e. language disorders or speech fluency disorder) that involve impairments in expressive language across all social situations. Although some children with selective mutism exhibit expressive language difficulties or phonological problems, these are often subtle, and functioning is usually found to be in the normal range. Selective mutism may occur in the presence of developmental speech and language disorders, and both can be diagnosed if warranted. Boundary with autism spectrum disorder and disorders of intellectual development Some individuals affected by autism spectrum disorder or disorders of intellectual development exhibit impairments in language and social communication. However, unlike in selective mutism, when language and communication impairments are present in autism spectrum disorder and disorders of intellectual development, they are notable across environments and social situations. Boundary with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorder Individuals with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders may exhibit disruptions in speech and social communication as a function of symptoms of disordered thought. Unlike individuals with selective mutism, those with disrupted communication in the context of psychotic disorders display similar disruptions to speech across all social situations. Boundary with social anxiety disorder Selective mutism is characterized by a failure to speak in specific situations, whereas in social anxiety disorder fear and anxiety result in avoidance of multiple social contexts.
