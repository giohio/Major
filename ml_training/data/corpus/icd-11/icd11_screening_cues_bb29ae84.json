Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders | Oppositional defiant disorder Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders 541 Boundary with normality (threshold) • Transient noncompliance, defiance and disobedience including irritability or anger can occur within the normal range of behaviour as a part of typical development, or in response to increased demands on the developing child or changes in the child’s environment (e.g. transition to a new school or city), or as a manifestation of normative anxiety in the context of specific tasks or situations (e.g. going to school and separating from parents for the first time).

Course features • The heterogeneity of presentations in oppositional defiant disorder has meaningful clinical and prognostic implications. Oppositional defiant disorder can be a developmental precursor for the development of conduct-dissocial disorder, especially when the presentation of oppositional defiant disorder includes severely defiant or spiteful/ vindictive behaviours. However, many children with oppositional defiant disorder do not subsequently develop conduct-dissocial disorder. • A diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder with chronic irritability-anger is associated with the subsequent development of depressive disorders and anxiety and fear-related disorders. Developmental presentations • Typical age of onset of oppositional defiant disorder is in middle childhood, with initial symptoms typically appearing at preschool age. Symptoms rarely emerge for the first time later than early adolescence. • Prevalence rates of oppositional defiant disorder are estimated at 3.3% among children and adolescents (aged 6–18 years). Some evidence suggests that overall prevalence of oppositional defiant disorder decreases beginning in adolescence and young adulthood. • Oppositional defiant disorder is more common among children and adolescents whose families have experienced substantial disruptions in caregiving relationships, or in which parenting practices tend to be harsh, inconsistent or neglectful. • Although oppositional and argumentative behaviours are common in typically developing children, unlike in oppositional defiant disorder, these behaviours tend to be transient and do not consistently negatively affect the child’s functioning and development.
