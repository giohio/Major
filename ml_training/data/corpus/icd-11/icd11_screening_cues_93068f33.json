Depending on the nature of the medical condition (e.g. a life-threatening type of cancer, a potentially fatal infection) or its onset (e.g. a heart attack, a stroke, a severe injury), being diagnosed and/or having to cope with a severe medical condition can be experienced as a traumatic event, which may trigger dissociative symptoms.

This judgement depends on establishing the following. • The medical condition is known to be capable of producing the symptoms. • The course of the symptoms (e.g. onset, remission, response to treatment of the etiological medical condition) is consistent with causation by the medical condition. • The symptoms are not better accounted for by delirium, dementia, another mental disorder (e.g. an impulse control disorder or a disorder due to addictive behaviours), or the effects of a medication or substance, including withdrawal effects. • The symptoms are sufficiently severe to be a specific focus of clinical attention.
