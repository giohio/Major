Such events include, but are not limited to, directly experiencing natural or human-made disasters, combat, serious accidents, torture, sexual violence, terrorism, assault or acute life-threatening illness (e.g. a heart attack); witnessing the threatened or actual injury or death of others in a sudden, unexpected or violent manner; and learning about the sudden, unexpected or violent death of a loved one. • Following the traumatic event or situation, the development of a characteristic syndrome lasting for at least several weeks consists of all three of the following core elements. • The traumatic event is re-experienced in the present: it is not just remembered but is experienced as occurring again in the here and now. This typically occurs in the form of vivid intrusive memories or images; flashbacks, which can vary from mild (there is a transient sense of the event occurring again in the present) to severe (there is a complete loss of awareness of present surroundings); or repetitive dreams or nightmares that are thematically related to the traumatic event. Re-experiencing is typically accompanied by strong or overwhelming emotions, such as fear or horror, and strong physical sensations. Re-experiencing in the present can also involve feelings of being overwhelmed or immersed in the same intense emotions that were experienced during the traumatic event, without a prominent cognitive aspect, and may occur in response to reminders of the event. Reflecting on or ruminating about the event and remembering the feelings experienced at that time are not sufficient to meet the re-experiencing requirement. • Reminders likely to produce re-experiencing of the traumatic event are deliberately avoided. Deliberate avoidance may take the form either of active internal avoidance of thoughts and memories related to the event, or external avoidance of people, conversations, activities or situations reminiscent of the event. In extreme cases, the person may change their environment (e.g. move to a different city or change jobs) to avoid reminders. • There are persistent perceptions of heightened current threat – for example, as indicated by hypervigilance or an enhanced startle reaction to stimuli such as unexpected noises.
