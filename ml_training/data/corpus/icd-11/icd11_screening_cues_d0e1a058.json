  "text_en": "should not be assigned to individuals with autism spectrum disorder based solely on pragmatic language impairment. The other forms of developmental language disorder (i.e. with impairment of receptive and expressive language or with impairment of receptive and expressive language) may be assigned in conjunction with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder if language abilities are markedly below what would be expected based on age and level of intellectual functioning. Boundary with developmental motor coordination disorder Individuals with autism spectrum disorder may be reluctant to participate in tasks requiring complex motor coordination skills, such as ball sports, which is better accounted for by a lack of interest rather than any specific deficits in motor coordination. However, developmental motor coordination disorder and autism spectrum disorder can co-occur, and both diagnoses may be assigned if warranted. Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Specific abnormalities in attention (e.g. being overly focused or easily distracted), impulsivity and physical hyperactivity are often observed in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. However, individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder do not exhibit the persistent deficits in initiating and sustaining social communication and reciprocal social interactions or the persistent restricted, repetitive and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or activities that are the defining features of autism spectrum disorder. However, autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder can co-occur, and both diagnoses may be assigned if the diagnostic requirements for each are met. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms may sometimes dominate the clinical presentation such that some autism spectrum disorder symptoms are less apparent. Boundary with stereotyped movement disorder Stereotyped movement disorder is characterized by voluntary, repetitive, stereotyped, apparently purposeless (and often rhythmic) movements that arise during the early developmental period. Although such stereotyped movements are typical in autism spectrum disorder, if they are severe enough to require additional clinical attention – for example, because of self-injury – a co-occurring diagnosis of stereotyped movement disorder may be warranted. Boundary with schizophrenia The onset of schizophrenia may be associated with prominent social withdrawal, which is either preceded by or results in social impairments that may resemble social deficits seen in autism spectrum disorder. However, unlike autism spectrum disorder, the onset of schizophrenia is typically in adolescence or early adulthood, and is extremely rare prior to puberty. Schizophrenia is differentiated on the basis of the presence of psychotic symptoms (e.g. delusions, hallucinations), as well as a lack of restricted, repetitive and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or activities during early childhood typical of autism spectrum disorder. Boundary with schizotypal disorder Interpersonal difficulties seen in autism spectrum disorder may share some features of schizotypal disorder, such as poor rapport with others and social withdrawal. However, autism spectrum disorder is also characterized by restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests or activities.
