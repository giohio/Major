  "text_en": "disorder Social anxiety disorder is associated with limited engagement in social interaction due to marked and excessive fear or anxiety about negatively evaluated by others. Typically, when interacting with familiar others or in social situations that do not provoke significant anxiety, there is no evidence of impairment. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder may experience social anxiety, but they also exhibit more pervasive deficits in initiating and sustaining social communication and reciprocal social interactions than are typically observed in social anxiety disorder. Persistent restricted, repetitive and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or activities are not features of social anxiety disorder. Boundary with selective mutism Selective mutism is characterized by normal use of language and patterns of social communication in specific environments (such as the home), but not in others (such as at school). In autism spectrum disorder, a reluctance to communicate may be observed in some social circumstances, but deficits in initiating and sustaining social communication and reciprocal social interactions and persistent restricted, repetitive and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or activities are evident across all situations and contexts. Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorder Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by persistent repetitive thoughts, images, or impulses/urges (i.e. obsessions) and/or repetitive behaviours (i.e. compulsions) that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, according to rigid rules, to reduce anxiety or to achieve a sense of “completeness”. These symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from restricted, repetitive and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or activities that are characteristic of autism spectrum disorder. Unlike those with autism spectrum disorder, it is more common for individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder consciously to resist their impulsive urges to perform compulsive behaviours (e.g. by performing alternate tasks), though adolescents and adults with autism spectrum disorder may also try to suppress specific behaviours that they realize are socially undesirable. Autism spectrum disorder can also be distinguished from obsessive-compulsive disorder by its characteristic deficits in initiating and sustaining social communication and reciprocal social interactions, which are not features of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Boundary with reactive attachment disorder Reactive attachment disorder is characterized by inhibited emotionally withdrawn behaviour exhibited towards adult caregivers, including a failure to approach a discriminated, preferred attachment figure for comfort, support, protection or nurturance. The diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder requires evidence of a history of severe neglect or maltreatment by the primary caregiver or other forms of severe social deprivation (e.g. certain types of institutionalization). Some individuals reared under conditions of severe deprivation in institutional settings exhibit autistic-like features, including difficulties in social reciprocity and restricted, repetitive and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or activities. Also referred to as “quasi-autism”, affected individuals are differentiated from those with autism spectrum disorder based on significant improvement of autism-like features when the child is moved to a more nurturing environment. Differentiation between reactive attachment disorder and autism spectrum disorder is difficult when no reliable evidence is available of intact social and communicative development prior to the onset of abuse or neglect. Boundary with disinhibited social engagement disorder Disinhibited social engagement disorder is characterized by persistent indiscriminate social approaches to unfamiliar adults and peers, a pattern of behaviour that may also be seen in some children with autism spectrum disorder. The diagnosis of disinhibited social engagement disorder requires evidence of a history of severe neglect or maltreatment by the primary caregiver or other forms of severe social deprivation (e.g. certain types of institutionalization).
