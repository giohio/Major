Boundary with dementia Some individuals with dementia accumulate objects as a result of progressive neurocognitive deficit. Unlike hoarding disorder, individuals with dementia display little interest in accumulating objects or distress associated with discarding items. Furthermore, collecting behaviour in dementia may be accompanied by severe personality and behavioural changes, such as apathy, sexual indiscretions and motor stereotyped movements. Boundary with Prader-Willi syndrome Prader-Willi syndrome is associated with an increased drive to eat and a range of compulsive symptoms, including food storing. The presence of short stature, hypogonadism, failure to thrive, hypotonia and a history of feeding difficulty in the neonatal period are helpful for the differential diagnosis with hoarding disorder. Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Hoarding disorder Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders 327 6B25 Body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders Body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders are characterized by recurrent and habitual actions directed at the integument (e.g. hair pulling, skin picking, lip biting), typically accompanied by unsuccessful attempts to decrease or stop the behaviour involved, and which lead to dermatological sequelae (e.g. hair loss, skin lesions, lip abrasions). The behaviour may occur in brief episodes scattered throughout the day or in less frequent but more sustained periods. General cultural considerations for body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders • People who may inflict bodily harm to themselves (e.g. self-flagellation or self-cutting) as a part of religious ceremonies should not be assigned this diagnosis. 6B25.0 Trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) Essential (required) features • The presentation is characterized by: • recurrent pulling of the individual’s hair; • unsuccessful attempts to stop or decrease hair pulling; • significant hair loss results from pulling behaviour. • The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Additional clinical features • Hair pulling may occur from any region of the body where hair grows. However, the most common sites are the scalp, eyebrows and eyelids. Less frequently reported sites are axillary, facial, pubic and peri-rectal regions. Patterns of hair loss are variable, with some areas of complete alopecia and others with thinning hair density. • Individuals with trichotillomania may pull hair in a widely distributed pattern (i.e. pulling single hairs from all over a site) such that hair loss may not be clearly visible. Alternately, individuals may attempt to conceal or camouflage hair loss (e.g. by using makeup, scarves or wigs).
