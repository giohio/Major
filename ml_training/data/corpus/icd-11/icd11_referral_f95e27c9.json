Boundary with personality disorder Conduct-dissocial disorder is not a personality disorder, although it is related to specific personality disorder categories in the clinical and research nomenclature (i.e. dissocial personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder). Personality disorder is characterized by a relatively enduring and pervasive disturbance in how individuals experience and interpret themselves, others and the world that results in maladaptive patterns of cognition, emotional experience, emotional expression and behaviour. These maladaptive patterns lead to significant problems in psychosocial functioning that are particularly evident in interpersonal relationships, manifested across a range of personal and social situations (i.e. not limited to specific relationships or situations). Individuals with personality disorder may have prominent dissocial features as an aspect of personality traits. The diagnosis of conduct-dissocial disorder is made based on a recurrent pattern of antisocial behaviour that may range in duration from a discrete period lasting a number of months to a pattern that persists across the lifespan. Conduct-dissocial disorder and personality disorder can co-occur, and both may be diagnosed if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met. Boundary with disorders due to substance use If the pattern of dissocial behaviour is limited to obtaining or using illicit substances, or if the behaviour is exclusively related to the effects of intoxication, dependence or withdrawal, conduct-dissocial disorder should not be diagnosed, and a disorder due to substance use should be considered instead. At the same time, co-occurrence of episodes of dissocial behaviour and substance use is common among individuals with conduct-dissocial disorder. This distinction may therefore depend on a complex clinical judgement that takes into account the onset, sequencing and context of the relevant behaviours.
