Neurodevelopmental disorders | Disorders of intellectual development 94 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders 6A00.1 Disorder of intellectual development, moderate • In moderate disorder of intellectual development, intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour are found to be approximately 3–4 standard deviations below the mean (approximately 0.003–0.1 percentile), based on appropriately normed, individually administered standardized tests. Where standardized tests are not available, assessment of intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour requires greater reliance on clinical judgement, which may include the use of behavioural indicators provided in Tables 6.1–6.4. Language and capacity for acquisition of academic skills of people affected by moderate disorder of intellectual development vary but are generally limited to basic skills. Some may master basic self-care, domestic and practical activities. Most affected people require considerable and consistent support in order to achieve independent living and employment as adults. 6A00.2 Disorder of intellectual development, severe • In severe disorder of intellectual development, intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour are found to be approximately 4 or more standard deviations below the mean (less than approximately the 0.003rd percentile), based on appropriately normed, individually administered standardized tests. Where standardized tests are not available, assessment of intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour requires greater reliance on clinical judgement, which may include the use of behavioural indicators provided in Tables 6.1–6.4. People affected by severe disorder of intellectual development exhibit very limited language and capacity for acquisition of academic skills. They may also have motor impairments and typically require daily support in a supervised environment for adequate care, but may acquire basic self-care skills with intensive training. Severe and profound disorders of intellectual development are differentiated exclusively on the basis of adaptive behaviour differences because existing standardized tests of intelligence cannot reliably or validly distinguish among individuals with intellectual functioning below the 0.003rd percentile. 6A00.3 Disorder of intellectual development, profound • In profound disorder of intellectual development, intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour are found to be approximately 4 or more standard deviations below the mean (approximately less than the 0.003rd percentile), based on individually administered appropriately normed, standardized tests. Where standardized tests are not available, assessment of intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour requires greater reliance on clinical judgement, which may include the use of behavioural indicators provided in Tables 6.1–6.4. People affected by profound disorder of intellectual development possess very limited communication abilities and capacity for acquisition of academic skills is restricted to basic concrete skills. They may also have co-occurring motor and sensory impairments and typically require daily support in a supervised environment for adequate care. Severe and profound disorders of intellectual development are differentiated exclusively on the basis of adaptive behaviour differences because existing standardized tests of intelligence cannot reliably or validly distinguish among individuals with intellectual functioning below the 0.003rd percentile.
