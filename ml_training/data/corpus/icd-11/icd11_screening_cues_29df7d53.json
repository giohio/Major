Note: behaviours associated with each area will vary according to the developmental stage of the child or adolescent, as well as the cultural context. This category should only be considered as applicable within a child or adolescent’s primary caregiving relationships, which may include relationships with parents, grandparents or other significant long-term caregivers. This category may be assigned to either the child or the caregiver, depending on who is being evaluated.
