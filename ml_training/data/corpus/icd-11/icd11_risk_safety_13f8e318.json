When there is no significant impairment of intellectual functioning, clinical services may only be sought later (e.g. due to behaviour or social problems when starting school). In middle childhood, there may be prominent symptoms of anxiety, including social anxiety disorder, school refusal and specific phobia. During adolescence and adulthood, depressive disorders are often a presenting feature. • Co-occurrence of autism spectrum disorder with other mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders is common across the lifespan. In a substantial proportion of cases – particularly in adolescence and adulthood – it is a co-occurring disorder that first brings an individual with autism spectrum disorder to clinical attention. • Pragmatic language difficulties may manifest as an overly literal understanding of others’ speech, speech that lacks normal prosody and emotional tone and therefore appears monotonous, lack of awareness of the appropriateness of their choice of language in particular social contexts, or pedantic precision in the use of language. • Social naivety, especially during adolescence, can lead to exploitation by others – a risk that may be enhanced by the use of social media without adequate supervision. • Profiles of specific cognitive skills in autism spectrum disorder as measured by standardized assessments may show striking and unusual patterns of strengths and weaknesses that are highly variable from individual to individual. These deficits can affect learning and adaptive functioning to a greater extent than would be predicted from the overall scores on measures of verbal and nonverbal intelligence. • Self-injurious behaviours (e.g. hitting one’s face, head banging) occur more often in individuals with co-occurring disorder of intellectual development. • Some young individuals with autism spectrum disorder – especially those with a co- occurring disorder of intellectual development – develop epilepsy or seizures during early childhood with a second increase in prevalence during adolescence. Catatonic states have also been described. A number of medical disorders such as tuberous sclerosis, chromosomal abnormalities including fragile X syndrome, cerebral palsy, early-onset epileptic encephalopathies and neurofibromatosis are associated with autism spectrum disorder with or without a co-occurring disorder of intellectual development. Genomic deletions, duplications and other genetic abnormalities are increasingly described in individuals with autism spectrum disorder, some of which may be important for genetic counselling. Prenatal exposure to valproate is also associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder. • Some individuals with autism spectrum disorder are capable of functioning adequately by making an exceptional effort to compensate for their symptoms during childhood,",
