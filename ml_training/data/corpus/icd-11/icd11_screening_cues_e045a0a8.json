In such cases, a substance-induced mental disorder should be diagnosed together with a primary diagnosis of episode of harmful psychoactive substance use, harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use or substance dependence. Boundary with mental disorders not induced by substances Substance-induced mental disorders are differentiated from mental disorders with similar features that are not induced by substances on the basis of their onset, course and clinical features. A diagnosis of substance-induced mental disorder requires evidence from history, physical or mental examination, or laboratory findings of recent substance use, intoxication or withdrawal. Most substance-induced mental disorders resolve or improve within several weeks of cessation of substance use. Mental disorders not induced by substances may precede the onset of substance use or may continue to be symptomatic during periods of sustained abstinence. The co-occurrence of substance use or withdrawal and onset of symptoms of mental disorders should not be taken as evidence for a presumptive diagnosis of a substance-induced mental disorder. Some people use substances to suppress symptoms of mental disorders (e.g. schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, mood disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders, personality disorders), and full symptomatic presentations only emerge upon cessation or reduction in substance use.
