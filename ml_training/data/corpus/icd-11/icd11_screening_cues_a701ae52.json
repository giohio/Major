Symptom specifiers Specific presenting symptoms in dissociative neurological symptom disorder may be identified using the following symptom specifiers. Multiple specifiers may be assigned as necessary to describe the clinical presentation. 6B60.0 with visual disturbance • This specifier can be applied if the dissociative neurological symptom disorder is characterized by visual symptoms such as blindness, tunnel vision, diplopia, visual distortions or hallucinations that are not consistent with a recognized disease of the nervous system, another mental disorder or another medical condition, and do not occur exclusively during another dissociative disorder. 6B60.1 with auditory disturbance • This specifier can be applied if the dissociative neurological symptom disorder is characterized by auditory symptoms such as loss of hearing or auditory hallucinations that are not consistent with a recognized disease of the nervous system, another mental disorder or another medical condition, and do not occur exclusively during another dissociative disorder.
