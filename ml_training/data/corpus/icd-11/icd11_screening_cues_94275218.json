Developmental presentations • Delusional disorder is more prevalent among older individuals. • Individuals who experience delusional disorder in early adulthood are more likely to have a history of hallucinations and severe psychopathology during adolescence. Culture-related features • Cultural factors may influence the presentation and diagnosis of delusional disorder. For example, spirit possession or witchcraft beliefs may be normative in some but not other cultures. • Individuals may present with a combination of delusions and overvalued ideas, both drawing on similar cultural idioms and beliefs. • Diverse populations that experience persecution (e.g. torture, political violence, discrimination due to minority status) may report fears that may be misjudged as paranoid delusions; these may represent instead appropriate fears of recurrence of being persecuted or symptoms of co-occurring post-traumatic stress disorder.
