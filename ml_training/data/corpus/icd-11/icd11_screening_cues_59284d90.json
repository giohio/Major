In contrast, individuals with conduct-dissocial disorder typically lack the symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity, and exhibit a repetitive and persistent pattern of behaviour in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms, rules or laws are violated. However, co-occurrence of these disorders is common. Boundary with personality disorder Individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder often experience problems with psychosocial functioning and interpersonal relationships, including regulation of emotions and negative emotionality. If attention deficit hyperactivity disorder persists into adolescence and adulthood, it may be difficult to distinguish from personality disorder with prominent personality features of disinhibition, which includes irresponsibility, impulsivity, distractibility and recklessness, and from negative affectivity, which refers to a habitual tendency to manifest a broad range of distressing emotions including anxiety, anger, self-loathing, irritability and increased sensitivity to negative stimuli. The utility of assigning an additional diagnosis of personality disorder in situations where there is an established diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder depends on the specific clinical situation. Boundary with disorders due to substance use and the effects of certain prescribed medications Abuse of alcohol, nicotine, cannabis and stimulants is common among individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder – particularly adolescents and adults. However, the effects of these substances can also mimic the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in individuals without the diagnosis. Symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity or impulsivity are also associated with the effects of certain prescribed medications (e.g. anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine and valproate, antipsychotics such as risperidone, and somatic treatments such as bronchodilators and thyroid replacement medication). The temporal order of onset and the persistence of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity in the absence of intoxication or continued medication use are important in differentiating between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and disorders due to substance use or the effects of prescribed medications. A review of current medications and informants who knew the individual before they started using the substances or medications in question are critical in making this distinction.
