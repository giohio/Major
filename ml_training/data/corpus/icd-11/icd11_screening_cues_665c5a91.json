Additional clinical features • Neurocognitive symptoms are progressive, and often involve relatively greater impairment in visuospatial skills, attention and executive functioning (as opposed to primary memory impairment, as seen in Alzheimer disease). • Additional clinical features may include repeated falls, syncope, hallucinations in other sensory modalities, delusions and autonomic dysfunction (e.g. constipation, urinary incontinence).
