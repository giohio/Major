Neurocognitive disorders | Dementia due to diseases classified elsewhere 632 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders 6D85.8 Dementia due to pellagra Essential (required) features • All diagnostic requirements for dementia are met. • Dementia is presumed to be attributable to pellagra, as demonstrated by neuropsychological test data, medical tests and/or clinical history. Additional clinical features • Dementia due to pellagra is caused by persistent lack of vitamin B (niacin) or tryptophan 3 either in the diet or due to poor absorption in the gastrointestinal tract due to disease (e.g. Crohn disease) or due to the effects of some medications (e.g. isoniazid). • Core signs of pellagra include dermatological changes (sensitivity to sunlight, lesions, alopecia and oedema) and diarrhoea. • With prolonged nutritional deficiency, neurocognitive symptoms that include aggression, motor disturbances (ataxia and restlessness), confusion and weakness may be observed. • Treatment with nutritional supplementation (e.g. niacin) typically results in reversal of symptoms. Note: a diagnosis of 5B5C.0 Pellagra in Chapter 5 on endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases should also be assigned. 6D85.9 Dementia due to Down syndrome Essential (required) features • All diagnostic requirements for dementia are met. • Dementia is presumed to be attributable to Down syndrome, as demonstrated by neuropsychological test data, genetic testing, medical tests and/or clinical history. Additional clinical features • Dementia due to Down syndrome is caused by abnormal increased production and accumulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to formation of beta-amyloid Neurocognitive disorders | Dementia due to diseases classified elsewhere Neurocognitive disorders | Dementia due to diseases classified elsewhere",
