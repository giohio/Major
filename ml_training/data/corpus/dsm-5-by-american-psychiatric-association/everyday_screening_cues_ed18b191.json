The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in Criterion A. C. The disturbance is not better explained by a sexual dysfunction that is not substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent sexual dysfunction could include the following: The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medica- tion use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute with- drawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence sug- gesting the existence of an independent non-substance/ medication-induced sexual dysfunction (e.g., a history of re- current non-substance/medication-related episodes). D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress in the indi- vidual. Note: This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of sub- stance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medication]-induced sexual dysfunctions are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced sexual dysfunction, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced sexual dysfunction (e.g., “mild cocaine",
