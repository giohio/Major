It also occurs with obesity (obesity hypoventilation disor- der), where it reflects a combination of increased work of breathing due to reduced chest wall compliance and ventilation-perfusion mis- match and variably reduced ventilatory drive. Such individuals usu- ally are characterized by body mass index of greater than 30 and hypercapnia during wakefulness (with a pCO of greater than 45), 2 without other evidence of hypoventilation. Specify current severity: Severity is graded according to the degree of hypoxemia and hy- percarbia present during sleep and evidence of end organ im- pairment due to these abnormalities (e.g., right-sided heart failure). The presence of blood gas abnormalities during wakeful- ness is an indicator of greater severity. Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders A. A persistent or recurrent pattern of sleep disruption that is primar- ily due to an alteration of the circadian system or to a misalign- ment between the endogenous circadian rhythm and the sleep- wake schedule required by an individual’s physical environment or social or professional schedule. B. The sleep disruption leads to excessive sleepiness or insomnia, or both. C. The sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or im- pairment in social, occupational,",
