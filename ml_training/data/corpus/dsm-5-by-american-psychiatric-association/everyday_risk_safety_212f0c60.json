Malingering differs from factitious disorder in that the motiva- tion for the symptom production in malingering is an external incen- tive, whereas in factitious disorder external incentives are absent. Malingering is differentiated from conversion disorder and somatic symptom–related mental disorders by the intentional production of symptoms and by the obvious external incentives associated with it. Definite evidence of feigning (such as clear evidence that loss of func- tion is present during the examination but not at home) would sug- gest a diagnosis of factitious disorder if the individual’s apparent aim is to assume the sick role, or malingering if it is to obtain an incentive, such as money. V40.31 (Z91.83) Wandering Associated With a Mental Disorder This category is used for individuals with a mental disorder whose desire to walk about leads to significant clinical management or safety concerns. For example, individuals with major neurocognitive or neurodevelopmental disorders may experience a restless urge to wander that places them at risk for falls and causes them to leave su- pervised settings without needed accompaniment. This category ex- cludes individuals whose intent is to escape an unwanted housing situation (e.g., children who are running away from home, patients who no longer wish to remain in the hospital) or those who walk or pace as a result of medication-induced akathisia. Coding note: First code associated mental disorder (e.g., major neu- rocognitive disorder, autism spectrum disorder), then code V40.31 (Z91.83) wandering associated with [specific mental disorder].",
