For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used. The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the substance- induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single code, for ICD- 9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of depressive symptoms occurring during with- drawal in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.84 cocaine-induced depressive disorder, with onset during with- drawal. An additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe cocaine use disorder is also given. When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of depressive mood symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., 292.84 methylphenidate-induced depressive dis- order, with onset during withdrawal; 292.84 dexamethasone-induced depressive disorder, with onset during intoxication).
