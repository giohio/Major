In grief, self-esteem is generally preserved, whereas in an MDE, feelings of worthlessness and self- loathing are common. If self-derogatory ideation is present in grief, it typically involves perceived failings vis-à-vis the deceased (e.g., not visiting frequently enough, not telling the deceased how much he or she was loved).
