Persistent difficulties in the acquisition and use of language across modalities (i.e., spoken, written, sign language, or other) due to deficits in comprehension or production that include the following: 1. Reduced vocabulary (word knowledge and use). 2. Limited sentence structure (ability to put words and word end- ings together to form sentences based on the rules of gram- mar and morphology). 3. Impairments in discourse (ability to use vocabulary and con- nect sentences to explain or describe a topic or series of events or have a conversation). B.
