Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced obsessive- compulsive and related disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced obsessive-compul- sive and related disorder”).
