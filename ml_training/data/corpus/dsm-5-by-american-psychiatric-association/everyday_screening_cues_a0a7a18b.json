Somatic type: This subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion involves bodily functions or sensations. Mixed type: This subtype applies when no one delusional theme predominates.

Specify if: With bizarre content: Delusions are deemed bizarre if they are clearly implausible, not understandable, and not derived from or- dinary life experiences (e.g., an individual’s belief that a stranger has removed his or her internal organs and replaced them with someone else’s organs without leaving any wounds or scars). Specify if: The following course specifiers are only to be used after a 1-year du- ration of the disorder: First episode, currently in acute episode: First manifestation of the disorder meeting the defining diagnostic symptom and time criteria. An acute episode is a time period in which the symptom criteria are fulfilled. First episode, currently in partial remission: Partial remission is a time period during which an improvement after a previous episode is maintained and in which the defining criteria of the dis- order are only partially fulfilled.",
