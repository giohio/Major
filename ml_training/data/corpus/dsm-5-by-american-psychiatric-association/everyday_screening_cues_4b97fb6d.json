Lack of remorse or guilt: Does not feel bad or guilty when he or she does something wrong (exclude remorse when ex- pressed only when caught and/or facing punishment). The individual shows a general lack of concern about the nega- tive consequences of his or her actions. For example, the in- dividual is not remorseful after hurting someone or does not care about the consequences of breaking rules. Callous—lack of empathy: Disregards and is unconcerned about the feelings of others. The individual is described as cold and uncaring. The person appears more concerned about the effects of his or her actions on himself or herself, rather than their effects on others, even when they result in substantial harm to others. Unconcerned about performance: Does not show concern about poor/problematic performance at school, at work, or in other important activities. The individual does not put forth the effort necessary to perform well, even when expectations are clear, and typically blames others for his or her poor per- formance.",
