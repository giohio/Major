Unspecified Stimulant-Related Disorder 273 Other Stimulant-Induced Disorders The following stimulant-induced disorders (which include amphet- amine-, cocaine-, and other stimulant–induced disorders) are de- scribed in other chapters of the book with disorders with which they share phenomenology (see the substance/medication-induced men- tal disorders in these chapters): stimulant-induced psychotic disorder (“Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders”); stimu- lant-induced bipolar disorder (“Bipolar and Related Disorders”); stimulant-induced depressive disorder (“Depressive Disorders”); stimulant-induced anxiety disorder (“Anxiety Disorders”); stimu- lant-induced obsessive-compulsive disorder (“Obsessive-Compul- sive and Related Disorders”); stimulant-induced sleep disorder (“Sleep-Wake Disorders”); and stimulant-induced sexual dysfunc- tion (“Sexual Dysfunctions”). For stimulant intoxication delirium, see the criteria and discussion of delirium in the chapter “Neurocognitive Disorders.” These stimulant-induced disorders are diagnosed instead of stimulant intoxication or stimulant withdrawal only when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical at- tention. Unspecified Stimulant-Related Disorder This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character- istic of a stimulant-related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important ar- eas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any specific stimulant-related disorder or any of the disorders in the sub- stance-related and addictive disorders diagnostic class.
