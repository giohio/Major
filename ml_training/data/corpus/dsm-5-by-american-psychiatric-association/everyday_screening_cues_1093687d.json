For example, in the case of anxiety symptoms occurring during withdrawal in a man with a se- vere lorazepam use disorder, the diagnosis is F13.280 severe loraze- pam use disorder with lorazepam-induced anxiety disorder, with on- set during withdrawal. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe lorazepam use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced anxiety disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F16.980 psilocybin-induced anxiety disor- der, with onset during intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of anxiety symp- toms, each should be listed separately (e.g., F15.280 severe methylphe- nidate use disorder with methylphenidate-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during intoxication; F19.980 salbutamol-induced anxiety disorder, with onset after medication use).
