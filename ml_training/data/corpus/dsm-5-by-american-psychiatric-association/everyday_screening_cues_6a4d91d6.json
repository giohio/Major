Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.0. The ICD-10-CM code for opioid withdrawal is F11.23. Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates the comorbid presence of a moderate or severe opioid use disorder, reflecting the fact that opioid withdrawal can only occur in the pres- ence of a moderate or severe opioid use disorder. It is not permis- sible to code a comorbid mild opioid use disorder with opioid withdrawal. Other Opioid-Induced Disorders The following opioid-induced disorders are described in other chap- ters of the book with disorders with which they share phenomenol- ogy (see the substance/medication-induced mental disorders in these chapters): opioid-induced depressive disorder (“Depressive Dis- orders”); opioid-induced anxiety disorder (“Anxiety Disorders”); opi- oid-induced sleep disorder (“Sleep-Wake Disorders”); and opioid- induced sexual dysfunction (“Sexual Dysfunctions”). For opioid in- toxication delirium and opioid withdrawal delirium, see the criteria and discussion of delirium in the chapter “Neurocognitive Disor- ders.” These opioid-induced disorders are diagnosed instead of opi- oid intoxication or opioid withdrawal only when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention.",
