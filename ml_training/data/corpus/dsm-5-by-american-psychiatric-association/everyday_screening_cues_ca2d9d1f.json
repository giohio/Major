A pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behav- ior, or vindictiveness lasting at least 6 months as evidenced by at least four symptoms from any of the following categories, and ex- hibited during interaction with at least one individual who is not a sibling. Angry/Irritable Mood 1. Often loses temper. 2. Is often touchy or easily annoyed. 3. Is often angry and resentful. Argumentative/Defiant Behavior 4.

For children younger than 5 years, the behavior should occur on most days for a period of at least 6 months, unless otherwise noted (Criterion A8). For individuals 5 years or older, the behavior should occur at least once per week 219",
