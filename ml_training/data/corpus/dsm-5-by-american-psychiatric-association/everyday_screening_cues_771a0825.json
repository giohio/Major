Medication-induced delirium: This diagnosis applies when the symptoms in Criteria A and C arise as a side effect of a medica- tion taken as prescribed. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code for [specific medication]- induced delirium is 292.81. The ICD-10-CM code depends on the type of medication. If the medication is an opioid taken as prescribed, the code is F11.921. If the medication is a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic taken as prescribed, the code is F13.921. If the medication is an amphetamine-type or other stimulant taken as prescribed, the code is F15.921. For medications that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone) and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the code is F19.921. 293.0 (F05) Delirium due to another medical condition: There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is attributable to the physiological consequences of another medical condition. Coding note: Include the name of the other medical condi- tion in the name of the delirium (e.g., 293.0 [F05] delirium due to hepatic encephalopathy). The other medical condition should also be coded and listed separately immediately be- fore the delirium due to another medical condition (e.g., 572.2 [K72.90] hepatic encephalopathy; 293.0 [F05] delirium due to hepatic encephalopathy). 293.0 (F05) Delirium due to multiple etiologies: There is evi- dence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory find- ings that the delirium has more than one etiology (e.g., more than one etiological medical condition; another medical condition plus substance intoxication or medication side effect). Coding note: Use multiple separate codes reflecting specific delirium etiologies (e.g., 572.2 [K72.90] hepatic encephalop- athy, 293.0 [F05] delirium due to hepatic failure; 291.0 [F10.231] alcohol withdrawal delirium).
