The other specified mental disorder due to another medical condition category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific mental disorder attributable to another medical condition. This is done by recording the name of the disorder, with the specific etiological medical condition inserted in place of “another medical condition,” followed by the specific symp- tomatic manifestation that does not meet the criteria for any specific mental disorder due to another medical condition. Furthermore, the di- agnostic code for the specific medical condition must be listed imme- diately before the code for the other specified mental disorder due to another medical condition. For example, dissociative symptoms due to complex partial seizures would be coded and recorded as 345.40 (G40.209) complex partial seizures, 294.8 (F06.8) other spec- ified mental disorder due to complex partial seizures, dissociative symptoms. An example of a presentation that can be specified using the “other specified” designation is the following: Dissociative symptoms: This includes symptoms occurring, for example, in the context of complex partial seizures. 341",
