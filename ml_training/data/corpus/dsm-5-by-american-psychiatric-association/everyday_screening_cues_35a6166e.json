The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Note: This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of sub- stance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and when they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medication]-induced depressive disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comor- bid with the substance-induced depressive disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced depressive disorder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced depressive disor- der”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced depressive disorder, the 4th position charac- ter is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the se- verity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the sub- stance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the substance-induced depressive disorder.",
