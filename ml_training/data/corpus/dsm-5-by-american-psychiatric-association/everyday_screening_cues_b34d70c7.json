Following the assessment of diagnostic criteria, clinicians should consider the application of disorder subtypes and/or specifiers as appropriate. Severity and course specifiers should be applied to de- note the individual’s current presentation, but only when the full criteria are met. When full criteria are not met, clinicians should con- sider whether the symptom presentation meets criteria for an “other specified” or “unspecified” designation. Where applicable, specific criteria for defining disorder severity (e.g., mild, moderate, severe, extreme), descriptive features (e.g., with good to fair insight; in a controlled environment), and course (e.g., in partial remission, in full remission, recurrent) are provided with each diagnosis. On the basis of the clinical interview, text descriptions, criteria, and clinician judg- ment, a final diagnosis is made. The general convention in DSM-5 is to allow multiple diagnoses to be assigned for those presentations that meet criteria for more than one DSM-5 disorder. Subtypes and Specifiers Subtypes and specifiers (some of which are coded in the fourth, fifth, or sixth digit) are provided for increased specificity. Subtypes define mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive phenomenological sub- groupings within a diagnosis and are indicated by the instruction “Specify whether” in the criteria set. In contrast, specifiers are not in- tended to be mutually exclusive or jointly exhaustive, and as a con- sequence, more than one specifier may be given. Specifiers are indicated by the instruction “Specify” or “Specify if” in the criteria set. Specifiers provide an opportunity to define a more homogeneous subgrouping of individuals with the disorder who share certain fea- tures (e.g., major depressive disorder, with mixed features) and to convey information that is relevant to the management of the indi- vidual’s disorder, such as the “with other medical comorbidity” specifier in sleep-wake disorders. Although a fifth digit is sometimes assigned to code a subtype or specifier (e.g., 294.11 [F02.81] major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease, with behavioral disturbance) or severity (296.21 [F32.0] major depressive disorder, sin- gle episode, mild), the majority of subtypes and specifiers included in",
