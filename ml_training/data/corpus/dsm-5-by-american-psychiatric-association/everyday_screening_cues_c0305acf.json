With onset after medication use: Symptoms may appear either at initiation of medication or after a modification or change in use. Recording Procedures ICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced obses- sive-compulsive and related disorder begins with the specific sub- stance (e.g., cocaine) that is presumed to be causing the obsessive- compulsive and related symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes, the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a sub- stance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used. The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset after medication use). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10- CM, which combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of repetitive behaviors occurring during intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.89 cocaine-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, with onset during intox- ication. An additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe cocaine use disorder is also given. When more than one substance is judged to play a sig- nificant role in the development of the obsessive-compulsive and re- lated disorder, each should be listed separately. ICD-10-CM.
