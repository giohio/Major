The temporal progression of signs and symp- toms provides important clues to the diagnosis and prognosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Alteration in mental status and other neurological signs typically precede systemic signs. The onset of symptoms varies from hours to days after drug initiation. Some cases develop within 24 hours after drug initiation, most within the first week, and virtually all cases within 30 days. Once the syndrome is diagnosed and oral antipsychotic drugs are discontinued, neuro- leptic malignant syndrome is self-limited in most cases. The mean recovery time after drug discontinuation is 7–10 days, with most in- dividuals recovering within 1 week and nearly all within 30 days. The duration may be prolonged when long-acting antipsychotics are implicated. There have been reports of individuals in whom residual",
