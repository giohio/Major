Coding note (for ICD-9-CM code 347.10 only): Code first the underlying medical condition (e.g., 040.2 Whipple’s dis- ease; 347.10 narcolepsy secondary to Whipple’s disease). Specify current severity: Mild: Infrequent cataplexy (less than once per week), need for naps only once or twice per day, and less disturbed nocturnal sleep. Moderate: Cataplexy once",
