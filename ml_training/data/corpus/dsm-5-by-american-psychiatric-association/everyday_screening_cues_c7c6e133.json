Current severity and psychotic features are only indicated if full criteria are currently met for a major depressive episode. Remission specifiers are only in- dicated if the full criteria are not currently met for a major depressive episode. Codes are as follows: Severity/course specifier Single episode Recurrent episode* Mild (p. 114) 296.21 (F32.0) 296.31 (F33.0) Moderate (p. 114) 296.22 (F32.1) 296.32 (F33.1) Severe (p. 114) 296.23 (F32.2) 296.33 (F33.2) With psychotic features** 296.24 (F32.3) 296.34 (F33.3) (p. 111) In partial remission (p. 114) 296.25 (F32.4) 296.35 (F33.41) 1In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is useful to consider that in grief the predominant affect is feelings of emptiness and loss, while in an MDE, it is persistent depressed mood and the inability to anticipate happiness or pleasure. The dysphoria in grief is likely to decrease in intensity over days to weeks and occurs in waves, the so-called pangs of grief. These waves tend to be associated with thoughts or reminders of the deceased. The depressed mood of an MDE is more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or preoccupations. The pain of grief may be accompanied by positive emotions and humor that are uncharacteristic of the pervasive unhappiness and misery characteristic of an MDE. The thought content associated with grief generally features a preoccupation with thoughts and memories of the deceased, rather than the self-critical or pessimistic ruminations seen in an MDE. In grief, self- esteem is generally preserved, whereas in an MDE, feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common.
