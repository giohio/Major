The name of the substance/medication-induced neu- rocognitive disorder begins with the specific substance/medication (e.g., alcohol) that is presumed to be causing the neurocognitive symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes, the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used. The name of the disorder (i.e., [specific substance]-induced major neurocognitive disorder or [specific substance]-induced mild neuro- cognitive disorder) is followed by the type in the case of alcohol (i.e., nonamnestic-confabulatory type, amnestic-confabulatory type), fol- lowed by specification of duration (i.e., persistent).
