This cate- gory should be used when a family’s high level of expressed emotion is the focus of clinical attention or is affecting the course, prognosis, or treatment of a family member’s mental or other medical disorder. V62.82 (Z63.4) Uncomplicated Bereavement This category can be used when the focus of clinical attention is a nor- mal reaction to the death of a loved one. As part of their reaction to such a loss, some grieving individuals present with symptoms char- acteristic of a major depressive episode—for example, feelings of sad- ness and associated symptoms such as insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss. The bereaved individual typically regards the depressed mood as “normal,” although the individual may seek professional help for relief of associated symptoms such as insomnia or anorexia. The duration and expression of “normal” bereavement vary consid- erably among different cultural groups. Further guidance in distin- guishing grief from a major depressive episode is provided in the criteria for major depressive episode. Abuse and Neglect Maltreatment by a family member (e.g., caregiver, intimate adult partner) or by a nonrelative can be the area of current clinical focus, or such maltreatment can be an important factor in the assessment and treatment of patients with mental or other medical disorders. Be- cause of the legal implications of abuse and neglect, care should be used in assessing these conditions and assigning these codes. Having a past history of abuse or neglect can influence diagnosis and treat- ment response in a number of mental disorders, and may also be noted along with the diagnosis. For the following categories, in addition to listings of the con- firmed or suspected event of abuse or neglect, other codes are pro- vided for use if the current clinical encounter is to provide mental health services to either the victim or the perpetrator of the abuse or neglect. A separate code is also provided for designating a past his- tory of abuse or neglect.
