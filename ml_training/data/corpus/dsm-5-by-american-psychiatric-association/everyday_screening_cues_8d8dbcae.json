  "text_en": "Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder 57 Specify if (see Table 1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addic- tive Disorders” for diagnoses associated with substance class): With onset during intoxication: If the criteria are met for intox- ication with the substance and the symptoms develop during in- toxication. With onset during withdrawal: If the criteria are met for with- drawal from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal. Specify current severity: Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms of psychosis, including delusions, hallucinations, ab- normal psychomotor behavior, and negative symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be rated for its current severity (most se- vere in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician-Rated Dimen- sions of Psychosis Symptom Severity in the chapter “Assess- ment Measures” in Section III of DSM-5.) Note: Diagnosis of substance/medication-induced psychotic dis- order can be made without using this severity specifier. Recording Procedures ICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced psy- chotic disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexa- methasone) that is presumed to be causing the delusions or hallucinations. The diagnostic code is selected from the table in- cluded in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For sub- stances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used. The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the substance- induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use 58 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders disorder. For example, in the case of delusions occurring during in- toxication in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.9 cocaine-induced psychotic disorder, with onset during intox- ication.",
