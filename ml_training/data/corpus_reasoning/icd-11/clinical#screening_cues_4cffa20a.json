In either case, the\ncore feature of a binge-eating episode is the experience of loss of control over eating.\n• Additional characteristics of binge-eating episodes may include eating much more rapidly\nthan usual, eating until feeling uncomfortably full, eating large amounts of food when not\nfeeling physically hungry, or eating alone because of embarrassment.\n• Binge eating is typically experienced as very distressing. This is often manifested in\nnegative emotions such as guilt, disgust or shame, which also typically negatively affect the\nindividual’s self-evaluation.\n• Bulimia nervosa may be associated with weight gain over time. However, individuals with\nbulimia nervosa may be of normal weight or even low weight (although not sufficiently\nlow to meet the diagnostic requirements for anorexia nervosa). The diagnosis of bulimia\nnervosa is based on the presence of regular binge eating and inappropriate compensatory\nbehaviours, regardless of overweight status.",
