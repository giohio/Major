Such rapid shifts would be unusual in schizophrenia. Negative symptoms\nare often present in schizophrenia, but do not occur in acute and transient psychotic disorder. The\nduration of acute and transient psychotic disorder does not exceed 3 months, and most often lasts\nfrom a few days to 1 month, compared to a much longer typical course for schizophrenia. In cases\nthat meet the diagnostic requirements for schizophrenia except that they have lasted less than the\nduration required for a diagnosis (i.e. 1 month) in the absence of a previous history of schizophrenia,\na diagnosis of other specified primary psychotic disorder and not acute and transient psychotic\ndisorder should be assigned.\nBoundary with schizotypal disorder\nSchizotypal disorder is characterized by an enduring pattern of unusual speech, perceptions,\nbeliefs and behaviours that resemble attenuated forms of the defining symptoms of schizophrenia.",
