  "content": "In developmental motor coordination disorder, individuals exhibit significant delays during the\ndevelopmental period in the acquisition of gross and fine motor skills, and impairment in the\nexecution of coordinated motor skills that manifest in clumsiness, slowness or inaccuracy of motor\nperformance. Individuals with disorders of intellectual development may also display such motor\ncoordination difficulties that affect adaptive behaviour functioning. In contrast to those with\ndevelopmental motor coordination disorder, individuals with disorders of intellectual development\nhave accompanying significant limitations in intellectual functioning. However, if coordinated\nmotor skills are significantly below what would be expected based on level of intellectual functioning\nand adaptive behaviour, and represent a separate focus of clinical attention, both diagnoses may\nbe assigned.\nBoundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\nIn attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, individuals show a persistent and generalized pattern\nof inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that emerges during the developmental period.\nIf all diagnostic requirements for a disorder of intellectual development are met, and inattention\nand/or hyperactivity-impulsivity are found to be outside normal expected limits based on age and\nlevel of intellectual functioning, with significant interference in academic, occupational or social\nfunctioning, both diagnoses may be assigned.\nBoundary with dementia",
