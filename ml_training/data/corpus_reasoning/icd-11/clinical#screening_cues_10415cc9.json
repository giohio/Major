Post-traumatic stress disorder\ncan be differentiated from specific phobia by the presence of the other core symptoms of post-\ntraumatic stress disorder (re-experiencing the trauma and persistent perceptions of heightened\ncurrent threat). They are further differentiated by the fact that – unlike in specific phobia, in\nwhich the memories of the related traumatic event are experienced as belonging to the past – in\npost-traumatic stress disorder and complex post-traumatic stress disorder, the traumatic event is\nexperienced as if it were occurring again in the here and now (i.e. re-experiencing).\nBoundary with feeding and eating disorders\nIndividuals with feeding and eating disorders exhibit abnormal eating behaviour and/or\npreoccupation with food as well as prominent body weight or shape concerns, and may avoid\nfood because they fear it will lead to weight gain or because of its specific sensory qualities. In\nsome specific phobias, individuals may avoid eating or food stimuli, but the avoidance is related to\nthe anticipated direct effect of the phobic stimulus (e.g. eating may lead to choking or vomiting)",
