As children grow older, direct demands by authority\nfigures typically become less frequent. Moreover, others interacting with children or\nadolescents with oppositional defiant disorder may come to avoid placing demands on\nthem due to their negative response. Therefore, a diagnosis is not precluded because\noppositional or defiant behaviours occur relatively infrequently, as long as they characterize\nmost interactions with authority figures.\n• Adults with oppositional defiant disorder continue to experience conflictual relationships\nwith parents and family members, and have generally poorer social support networks.",
