For substances that do\nnot fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for “other\nsubstance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged\nto be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is un-\nknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used.\nThe name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset\n(i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal).
