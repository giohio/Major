For example, the clinician\nshould record 292.0 (F13.239) secobarbital withdrawal (rather than\nsedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal) or 292.89 (F15.129) meth-\namphetamine intoxication (rather than stimulant intoxication). Note\nthat the appropriate ICD-10-CM diagnostic code for intoxication de-\npends on whether there is a comorbid substance use disorder. In this\ncase, the F15.129 code for methamphetamine indicates the presence of\na comorbid mild methamphetamine use disorder. If there had been no\ncomorbid methamphetamine use disorder, the diagnostic code would\nhave been F15.929. ICD-10-CM coding rules require that all with-\ndrawal codes imply a comorbid moderate to severe substance use dis-\norder for that substance. In the above case, the code for secobarbital\nwithdrawal (F13.239) indicates the comorbid presence of a moderate\nto severe secobarbital use disorder.
